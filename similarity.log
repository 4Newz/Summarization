And the layoff charges keep coming: in just the one month of 2024 so far, the company has already spent $700 million on employee severance charges as part of layoffs targeting another 1,000-plus roles. Alphabet, Google�s parent company, revealed the figure alongside its fourth-quarter earnings release on Tuesday.\n\nDespite the cuts, Google ended 2023 with growth across most of its core business lines. Google posted $86 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 13 percent increase year over year. The search giant�s core digital ads and cloud computing businesses also showed steady growth, which CEO Sundar Pichai credited to Google�s investments in generative AI.\n\nClosing down offices cost Google, too\n\nGoogle�s primary revenue generator, its search engine business, generated $48 billion, a nearly 13 percent jump year over year. The company�s subscription services and devices segment generated $10.7 billion, thanks primarily to subscriptions to YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV, and Google One, according to Pichai. YouTube�s advertising revenue was $9.2 billion, a 15 percent spike from last year.\n\nOn a call with investors, Pichai referred to 2024 as Alphabet�s �Gemini era,� referring to the company�s AI language model that it expects to work across all of Google�s core products. �Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams,� Pichai said. Coming around the bend is Gemini Ultra, an update of the original model which the company is still working on. �Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next version and bringing it to our products, starting with Search.�\n\nGoogle is currently the third-largest cloud provider in the world, trailing behind Microsoft�s Azure and AWS. But the cloud division picked up steam last year.

This decision comes as the company faces increasing competition, profit pressures, and a series of analyst downgrades. The layoffs, which will affect about 2,500 employees, are part of Chriss�s strategy to streamline the company and enhance its agility and profitability.\n\nChriss, who took the reins at PayPal in September, emphasized the need to �right-size� the organization through both direct cuts and the elimination of open roles. This restructuring aims to enable PayPal to respond more swiftly to customer needs and foster profitable growth. The company, which had around 29,900 employees at the end of 2022, had previously executed a similar round of layoffs in January of the same year.\n\nPayPal�s shares have seen a significant decline, dropping over 20% in the past year amid faltering earnings and lowered guidance for its full-year adjusted operating margin. The appointment of Chriss as CEO was a response to these challenges, as he replaced former CEO Dan Schulman.\n\nThe payments giant, once a pioneer in the industry, now grapples with stiff competition from entities like Apple Inc. and Zelle. This competitive landscape has led to at least four analysts downgrading PayPal�s stock this month, citing concerns ranging from increased rivalry to profitability pressures.\n\nOn the third-quarter earnings call, Chriss acknowledged the company�s �cost base and complex structure� as impediments to progress. He has committed to addressing these issues to improve PayPal�s operating leverage. The company, based in San Jose, California, is expected to report its fourth-quarter results in the coming week.\n\nChriss�s tenure so far has been marked by a reshuffling of leadership roles and a clear intent to streamline operations, which had expanded significantly during the pandemic. This move mirrors actions by other companies in the sector, such as Block Inc., which also announced job cuts as part of its workforce reduction plan.\n\nLayoffs across the industry\n\nThe recent layoffs at PayPal are part of a broader trend of workforce reductions across the tech industry. Several major companies, including Google and Microsoft, have also announced significant job cuts, reflecting the challenges faced by the sector in the current economic climate.\n\nGoogle, one of the tech giants, has recently initiated layoffs affecting hundreds of employees. The decision comes as the company navigates through a period of economic uncertainty and shifting market demands. This move by Google is indicative of the broader industry trend where companies are reassessing their workforce needs in response to changing business environments.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft has announced plans to lay off approximately 1,900 employees, impacting its Xbox and Activision Blizzard divisions. This decision is part of Microsoft�s broader strategy to streamline operations and focus on key growth areas, particularly as the company integrates the newly acquired Activision Blizzard. The layoffs at Microsoft underscore the challenges faced by even the largest players in the tech industry as they adapt to a rapidly evolving market.', date='2024-01-30T20:44:48Z', url='https://readwrite.com/paypal-joins-tech-layoff-wave-with-major-workforce-reduction/', source='ReadWrite', urlToImage='https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALL�E-2024-01-30-21.41.41-Create-a-realistic-photo-of-a-corporate-office-building-with-the-PayPal-logo-depicting-a-somber-mood-with-employees-exiting-the-building-under-overc-900x514.png', Similarity=0.3821159572050194, db_source='newsAPI', nlp_summary='PayPal is set to layoff approximately 9% of its workforce, a move announced by CEO Alex Chriss in a recent letter to staff, as per a recent Bloomberg report.\nThe layoffs, which will affect about 2,500 employees, are part of Chriss�s strategy to streamline the company and enhance its agility and profitability.\nThis restructuring aims to enable PayPal to respond more swiftly to customer needs and foster profitable growth.\nLayoffs across the industryThe recent layoffs at PayPal are part of a broader trend of workforce reductions across the tech industry.\nThe layoffs at Microsoft underscore the challenges faced by even the largest players in the tech industry as they adapt to a rapidly evolving market.'), Article(heading='The Google Assistant shortcut is disappearing from the Pixel Launcher', content='What you need to know\n\nThe microphone icon, which is found in the search bar on the Pixel Launcher home screen, has now been re-mapped.\n\nThe change was announced earlier this month alongside the removal of 17 features in Google Assistant.\n\nThe microphone button was previously a Google Assistant shortcut. Now, it will respond to questions with Google Search results.\n\nIt\'s never exciting to see a product or app lose functionality rather than gain it, but that\'s what is happening with Google Assistant. Earlier this month, Google announced that it would be removing 17 "underutilized" features from Assistant. The move came amidst a flurry of layoffs, which have since been confirmed to continue.\n\nThe purge of features is now beginning, and Pixel Launcher users will notice that the microphone icon in the search bar no longer triggers Assistant (via 9to5Google). The conversion of this icon\'s purpose from serving as a Google Assistant shortcut to a Google Search tool is now "rolling out," for lack of a better phrase.\n\nFor what it\'s worth, Google does not see this change as the removal of a feature. Instead, the company said in a blog post that the shift was intended to create "a more consistent experience. Google also said that the most popular use case for the microphone icon is to get Google Search results, so perhaps the removal of the Assistant shortcut will benefit some users.\n\nOfficially, the microphone icon in the search bar in the Pixel Launcher will now activate Voice Search. You can ask Google a question, and it will respond with results from Search.\n\nHowever, activating the Google Assistant may be slower in some cases following the shortcut\'s removal. You can still trigger Assistant by saying "Hey Google" or by long-pressing the home or power buttons. Completing certain actions that require a voice assistant might be more difficult, though, especially if you aren\'t in the position to say, "Hey, Google."\n\nThe good thing is that Google is actively communicating the change to users. After a user has received the update to re-map the microphone icon, they will be greeted with a pop-up that explains what\'s new. "Access to Google Assistant has moved," the message reads. "The microphone button on the search bar now opens Google Voice Search instead of Assistant."\n\nA potential concern is that many users have muscle memory from using Assistant through Pixel Launcher for years, which may cause some frustration as they adjust.

Alphabet\'s Q4 earnings report shows that the company made $83.3 billion in Q4 alone.\n\nIts full-year revenue was $307 billion, a 9% increase from 2022. According to the report, Search and YouTube subscriptions were major contributors to Q4 growth.\n\nHowever, Google also spent $2.1 billion in employee severance after laying off over 12,000 employees in 2023. On the earnings call, Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat hinted at more layoffs and a slower hiring pace in the near future as they continue to focus on "removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity." Google\'s generative AI remained the focus of the Q4 earnings call, with Pichai calling it the \'Gemini Era.\'\n\nMeanwhile, other companies like Meta, Amazon, and Qualcomm also released earnings this week, speaking about the latest developments in their services and the incorporation of AI in their systems.\n\nGemini Pro is going global as Bard picks up new skills\n\nSpeaking of the Gemini Era, Google announced Gemini Pro last year. Starting February 1, Gemini Pro will power Google Bard worldwide as it is available in more than 40 languages and over 230 countries and territories.\n\nWith Gemini Pro, Bard gets a new tool called "double-check," which cross-checks Bard\'s answer against similar internet results to check for accuracy and facts, improving users\' trust in Bard.\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nAnother cool feature that was introduced was Imagen 2, the text-to-image model. With this tool, users can generate images that are higher in quality and accuracy when compared to other such AI image generators. Google claims that they have specifically worked on areas where some image generators struggle with things like text, faces, and hands.\n\nThe Imagen 2 model is equipped to generate images in Google Ads, Duet AI in Google Workspace, and the Search Generative Experience. Imagen 2 powers ImageFX, an image generation tool currently available in Labs.\n\nAmazon gave up a $1.9 Billion deal with iRobot\n\n(Image credit: iRobot)\n\nEarlier this week, Amazon announced that it has come to a "mutual" agreement with iRobot to terminate its previous $1.4 billion deal to acquire the Roomba maker. Leaving the deal will resolve "all outstanding matters" alongside the termination fee both companies agreed upon prior.\n\nAmazon will have to pay iRobot $94 million due to the termination of the acquisition. On Monday (January 29), EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said that "the acquisition of iRobot would have enabled Amazon to foreclose iRobot\'s rivals by restricting or degrading access to Amazon stores."\n\nHowever, according to Reuters, Amazon and iRobot agreeing to part ways seems to correlate to the resistance it faced in the EU.\n\nThe deal\'s termination has caused significant challenges, with iRobot\'s now-former Chairman and CEO, Colin Angle, resigning and 35% of the company\'s staff being laid off.\n\n(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)\n\nGoogle issued a new Android 14 update on Thursday (February 1). However, this update only comes to the Google Pixel 5a owners.\n\nAccording to Google\'s beta release notes (via the Android Beta Reddit), QPR2 Beta 3.2 (build AP11.231215.010) addresses 15 issues that an earlier update to the phone may have caused. The update is rolling out now, and Pixel 5a owners should receive it within the next five days.\n\nIf you have a Pixel 5a, you can update your phone by navigating to Settings > System > System update.\n\nMeanwhile, we\'re still waiting on the stable version of QPR2 to roll out to Pixel phones, which we expect could happen in February or March (when the next feature drop is expected).\n\nGoogle Maps can now help you plan your outdoor activities\n\n(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)\n\nWith Gen AI, Google is trying to enhance the Maps experience by taking it a step further. Users in the U.S. will soon find the option to write a query or choose from a selection of pre-made ones on Google Maps.\n\nFor example, when you type in"places with a vintage vibe in SF," Google says Maps\' AI will list out businesses and places around you that fit the description of the prompt. It will also pull up reviews, images, and ratings of the locations close by. These results are also categorized by type/activity, i.e., clothing stores, vinyl shops, flea markets, etc.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Google) (Image credit: Google)\n\nAs of now, this feature is only rolling out to "local guides" in the U.S. Individuals who go out and review places to see/ restaurants in the area.\n\nThose are some of the biggest stories from this week.

And the Android Gemini app is coming for Google Assistant\'s position as the default voice assistant option for Android phones.\n\nWith the Gemini AI, you can have it generate stories from prompts, give you answers to coding problems, search an uploaded image for information, or give you contextual information based on your location or data from other Google apps.\n\nBelow, we\'ll break down how the different versions of Gemini work, where you can access it, whether you should pay for Gemini Advanced, and everything else you need to know.\n\nHow Google Gemini works\n\nGoogle Gemini, like Google Search, responds to questions by pulling from its own database or other sources to answer them. The difference is that Gemini tries to format its own conversational responses instead of highlighting third-party sources.\n\nUsing Google\'s Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) and its open-source "Transformer" machine-learning model, Gemini "reads" trillions of words from every publicly available source � then uses it to mimic human responses.\n\nGemini is "purposefully limited" in terms of remembering prior questions. Eventually, Gemini will support "longer conversations," but for now, each of your questions will be contextually isolated.\n\nHow to access Google Gemini\n\nGo to gemini.google.com/app to access the generative AI on any device, across all available languages and countries (more on that later).\n\nIf you\'re Google account is controlled under Family Link, Google Workspace for Education, or a Workspace where your administrator hasn\'t enabled Gemini, then you won\'t be able to access the tool. You need a valid Google account for it to work.\n\nAlthough some Gemini tools are Pixel 8-exclusive, you can download the Google Gemini Android app to access the AI directly on most of the best Android phones. If you have Google Assistant as your default voice assistant, downloading the Gemini app will automatically make it take that default spot (so long as you\'re eligible to use it).\n\nGoogle also promises to offer Gemini on iPhones and iPads through the standard Google app. Google says you\'ll have the option to enable Gemini under Settings > Voice in the iOS Google app; after that, the Gemini will appear as a new tab. As of publication, it\'s not available yet.\n\nIn either case, the Gemini mobile app only works in English for now; we expect Google to expand to other supported languages in time.\n\nLastly, you should know how to control Gemini Extensions to other Google apps like Maps, Hotels, Flights, YouTube, and Workspace. This Gemini Extensions management page lets you toggle specific apps on and off, as needed.\n\nWhere is Google Gemini available?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe standard version of the Google Gemini AI is "currently available in more than 40 languages and over 230 countries and territories," according to a Google Support page. After Google brought Gemini to Canada after a legal delay, it has very few territories left where it doesn\'t support the Gemini AI.\n\nThat said, you do need a legitimate Google account to access it, as mentioned above. You must be 18 or older in the European Economic Area (EEA), Canada, Switzerland, or the UK; in other areas, you must be at least 13 � or 14�17 in specific countries � with an unrestricted account.\n\nGemini Nano, Pro, and Advanced\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nGemini AI works differently and has varying levels of abilities, depending on where and how you access it.\n\nMost Gemini processes rely on cloud computing, requiring a network connection. For smartphone applications meant to work immediately with neural processing unit (NPU) power, Google offers Gemini Nano. Available on phones like the Pixel 8 Pro, Gemini Nano powered features in the December 2023 feature drop like smart replies in Whatsapp or a summary tool for the Recorder app.\n\nGemini Pro is the standard Gemini experience you get any time you ask the AI a question. Google calls it "Pro" because it\'s letting developers integrate Pro into their Android apps. Samsung, for instance, has added Gemini Pro into its apps � such as Samsung Notes, Voice Recorder, and Keyboard � on the Galaxy S24 series.\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nGemini Advanced pulls from an AI called Ultra 1.0 for its answers. Google says this AI is "more capable at highly complex tasks like coding, logical reasoning, following nuanced instructions, and creative collaboration."\n\nGoogle doesn\'t specify how much better Gemini Advanced does than standard Gemini, though its Gemini announcement post does explain how Ultra 1.0 specifically does better than Chat-GPT4 in areas like massive multitask language understanding (MMLU), reasoning, reading comprehension, basic and challenging math problems, and python code generation.\n\nGemini Advanced AI cost\n\nGoogle restricts Advanced to a $19.99 Google One AI Premium Plan, though you can get two free months of service before you have to pay.\n\nYou can\'t pay for Gemini Advanced by itself, as of now. If you\'re already paying for Premium ($9.99/month), then you\'ll pay just $10 more for Gemini Advanced � plus identical perks like 2TB of storage, a Google VPN, and Photos AI tricks like Magic Eraser � with the promise of integration into other Google apps like Gmail and Docs down the road.\n\nKeep in mind that if you subscribe to a Google One AI Premium Family plan, only the main account user gets access to the AI; every other family member only receives benefits like extra storage and advanced Photos editing tools.\n\nUltimately, your choice on whether to pay for Gemini Advanced will depend on whether you use Gemini casually, professionally, or academically. If you need an AI to help you check your coding work or your homework, you might benefit from the reassurance that Gemini Ultra 1.0 is less likely to hallucinate and give you false info.\n\nOn the other hand, that "1.0" in the name is relevant: You may want to wait until Gemini Advanced has had more time to improve before you spend money on it.\n\nGoogle Gemini (and Bard) controversy\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\nGoogle Bard got off to a rocky, controversial start. While the Gemini AI rebranding is meant to shake off the bad moments, it, too, isn\'t without controversy.\n\nDuring the initial Google Bard reveal, it gave the wrong answer to a question during its reveal, prompting some employees to state that Google Bard had been rushed out.\n\nAnother point of controversy came when a former Google engineer, Jacob Devlin, claimed that Google trained Bard on ShareGPT, a forum where people post the AI\'s responses. And an internal source claimed that Google only stopped doing this when Devlin criticized the practice.\n\nGoogle itself says that "Bard is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT," so we can\'t be certain if this is true or not.\n\nAfter Bard\'s launch, Google\'s "Godfather of AI" quit, noting the overall dangers of AI to spread misinformation and take away people\'s jobs. Google has laid off tens of thousands of workers in the past year, and cited AI policies when justifying its most recent layoffs in the engineering and ad sales teams.\n\nLater, we learned that the people tasked with training and improving Bard are dealing with stressful working conditions, given just three minutes to determine how accurate a response is when that answer might require significant research.\n\nThe latest controversy is specific to Gemini, as Google swaps it in to replace Assistant. Gemini for Android users criticized missing features like podcasts, routines, and reminders. Gemini project lead Jack Krawczyk also pointed out issues like "preachy guardrails" and the need for an interpreter to understand coding responses. Of course, these kinds of issues can be expected for a major software launch; the question is how quickly Google will resolve them.\n\nTimeline and future upgrades\n\n(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)\n\nSince Google Bard launched on March 21, 2023, Google has continued to innovate what the chatbot is capable of, leading up to the Gemini launch.\n\nIn May 2023, Google Bard began showing images from Search in responses, giving you more context for your questions.\n\nThe following month, it allowed mobile users to provide their location data for context-sensitive results, such as asking for the best hotel or restaurant nearby. Or for those using Bard for professional work, Google added the option to export responses to Google Sheets and more intelligent responses to coding questions.\n\nJuly 2023 was a major month for Google Bard, as it expanded to Europe with more than 40 new languages available, including Arabic, Chinese, German, Hindi, and Spanish.\n\nIt also started working with Google Lens to better contextualize your uploaded photos, while also letting you change whether Bard\'s responses were more casual or professional, or either long or short.\n\nIn September, Google had Bard reach out its tendrils to sync with other major Google apps and gather more useful information. Real-time data from Maps, YouTube, Hotels, and Flights were added, as well as the option to pull from your personal Gmail, Docs, and Drive.\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nOctober brought long-expected news: Google announced "Assistant with Bard," a combination of the two popular platforms that would make Bard easier to access on Android phones using the usual Assistant shortcut. This would eventually become Gemini.\n\nThat same month, Google added a neat email-summarizing tool that would help you scan through the new arrivals in your inbox, rather than having to click them one by one.\n\nWhile Google Bard was only available for adults at first, Google launched a Bard for Teens version in November that made specific results available and restricted any possible inappropriate content. Then, in December, Google preemptively restricted Bard responses to election questions to avoid accidental misinformation.\n\nThings slowed down for Bard until Google announced the Gemini AI in February 2024. Gemini replaced Bard as the browser-based chatbot, came to Android phones as a replacement for Google Assistant, and gained an Advanced (paid) version with better smarts.\n\nIn the near future, the Gemini team will focus on improving the app experience and expanding it to more countries and languages. Gemini Pro should come to more Android apps, while Samsung\'s Galaxy AI incorporates some of Gemini\'s tricks.', date='2024-02-14T16:48:36Z', url='https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini', source='Android Central', urlToImage='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CWkqBjQwgmSW9hT6fCrVL-1200-80.jpg', Similarity=0.2930351797099764, db_source='newsAPI', nlp_summary="Rebranded from Google Bard, Gemini uses the same core Google AI algorithms, data, and general language.\nThe mobile-based Gemini Nano, mainline Gemini Pro, and top-tier Gemini Advanced all expand on Google Bard's original template.\nHow Google Gemini worksGoogle Gemini, like Google Search, responds to questions by pulling from its own database or other sources to answer them.\nAfter Google brought Gemini to Canada after a legal delay, it has very few territories left where it doesn't support the Gemini AI.\nDuring the initial Google Bard reveal, it gave the wrong answer to a question during its reveal, prompting some employees to state that Google Bard had been rushed out."), Article(heading="Google's new AI-powered wingman highlights the challenges of using a tool that could eventually replace you", content='', date='2024-02-15T14:16:00Z', url='https://www.businessinsider.com/google-new-ai-tool-highlights-risks-tech-taking-jobs-2024-2', source='Business Insider', urlToImage='https://i.insider.com/5de809f5fd9db24fbc73b12a?width=1200&format=jpeg', Similarity=0.29114383459091187, db_source='newsAPI', nlp_summary=''), Article(heading='The job market for startups and Big Tech is in a weird spot', content='', date='2024-02-07T14:35:21Z', url='https://www.businessinsider.com/startup-jobs-venture-capital-big-tech-work-2024-2', source='Business Insider', urlToImage='https://i.insider.com/65c375da6fcb546d2d4ce5f9?width=1200&format=jpeg', Similarity=0.29114383459091187, db_source='newsAPI', nlp_summary='')]
