      "['As world leaders gathered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for the annual UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 28), many organizations took advantage of their presence to convene high-level events. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) covered selected events that took place on 1 December, alongside the World Climate Action Summit.\\n\\nA high-level roundtable celebrated the one-year anniversary of the International Drought Resilience Alliance (IDRA), which was launched at UNFCCC COP 27 in November 2022, during the Leaders’ Summit. The Alliance is under the leadership of Macky Sall, President of Senegal, and Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain.\\n\\nIn opening remarks, Sánchez mentioned tangible results during the Alliance’s first year, including: six new countries – Australia, Colombia, the Comoros, Italy, Paraguay, and Uruguay – joining IDRA; publications such as the Global Drought Snapshot 2023 Report, launched at COP 28; and developing new financial mechanisms to leverage funds. He announced that Spain will host a high-level meeting on droughts in 2024.\\n\\nIbrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary, UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), noted that while droughts were once viewed as only affecting some regions, they are now a global threat, impacting on livelihoods and ecosystems and fueling displacement and conflicts.\\n\\nHindou Oumarou Ibrahim, speaking for the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad, noted the ripple effects of drought, which has doubled the cost of food and produced and led to more household debt.\\n\\nOther speakers, including the Presidents of Mauritania and Senegal, highlighted that droughts affect 1.84 billion people throughout the world, with 85% of them living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). They also emphasized:\\n\\ninterlinkages between conflicts and droughts, noting one can exacerbate the other;\\n\\nour improper use of freshwater – an intersectional issue that impacts agriculture and food production;\\n\\nIDRA as a useful tool for collective efforts to restore and sustainably manage soil;\\n\\nthe need to reinforce the capacities of youth, including young women; and\\n\\nthe need to ensure that UNCCD is given the same platforms and attention as the other Rio Conventions, and is not marginalized.\\n\\nThe event was organized by the UNCCD Secretariat and IDRA.\\n\\nAnother high-level event, convened by the Government of Botswana and supported by the UN Science-Policy-Business Forum (UN-SPBF), addressed the climate crisis and human settlements nexus in Africa. It explored integrated, cooperative multilateral approaches to tackle some of Africa’s pressing climate challenges.\\n\\nDuring the event, President of Botswana Mokgweetsi Masisi highlighted the need for smart investments promoting value addition in the transition away from fossil fuels and harnessing the continent’s potential in solar energy. He said while returns on investment are part of the solution, “reparations must be a driving principle” as well.\\n\\nOther speakers, including the President of Namibia, referred to: the operationalization of the loss and damage fund at COP 28 as a huge step forward; the need to fill the finance gap to the required USD 1.8 trillion before 2030 and for rapid disbursements to developing countries; knowledge and data to ensure targeted responses consider specific needs of each community; and efforts to promote a holistic, cross-ministerial approach to sustainable development.\\n\\nAnother event saw the launch of the Multilevel Action & Urbanization Pavilion. Co-convened by UN-Habitat and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), this event highlighted interlinkages between urbanization, climate change, and people and communities at the frontlines of climate change.\\n\\nAddressing participants former US Vice President Al Gore compared the climate movement to the “great moral-based” movements of the past, such as the civil right and women’s suffrage movements in the US.\\n\\nKatrin Jammeh, ICLEI, pointed out that, while cities account for 70% of emissions, the local level receives less than 15% of global funding.\\n\\nDuring a Multi-level Action Dialogue, speakers noted:\\n\\nthe potential of local efforts to create a domino effect leading to positive change at a global scale;\\n\\na Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, initiative to create a clean truck programme that was bolstered by state and federal funding and inspired global efforts to implement green shipping;\\n\\nBrazil’s reduction of deforestation by 40% in 2023, while increasing affordable housing, creating jobs, and developing sustainable infrastructure in Amazonian cities; and\\n\\nthe SusHi Tech Tokyo 2024 initiative in pursuit of Tokyo’s commitment to halve their carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.\\n\\nHighlighting agriculture as the primary sector impacted by loss and damage due to climate change-related events, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) organized an event looking at loss and damage in agrifood systems.\\n\\nFAO Director General QU Dongyu emphasized the need for, among others, innovations in information management to measure loss and damage and build efficiency in agrifood systems.\\n\\nDuring the event, FAO launched a report titled, ‘Loss and Damage in Agrifood Systems: Addressing Gaps and Challenges,’ which highlights the need for improved methodologies to track loss and damage, increase investment in data collection, and increase financing. The report indicates that the agriculture sector is losing, on average, USD 123 billion per year due to disaster events, but that data on climate-related loss and damage are “scant or non-existent.”\\n\\nA Youth, Indigenous Peoples, and First Nations representative pointed to the inability of Indigenous Peoples in Canada to access the loss and damage fund because they live in a developed country.\\n\\nOther speakers highlighted that: Indigenous Peoples should have a seat at the table as they are rights holders; slow-onset events, such as increasing water salinity and drought, often become more prominent as their effects reverberate across economic sectors; and data harmonization can connect “the local to the global.”', 'Reminders of the war in Gaza punctuated the speeches on Friday at the annual United Nations climate summit on a day when fighting between Israel and Hamas resumed after a weeklong cease-fire. Isaac Herzog, the president of Israel, and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, were both scheduled to address the summit, but neither spoke.\\n\\nNevertheless, other Middle Eastern heads of state used their time to speak in support of the Palestinians.\\n\\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan almost immediately turned his speech to the war in Gaza, calling attention to more than 13,000 Palestinian civilians killed by Israel’s military campaign, according to Gazan health authorities, and saying that leaders should not talk about climate change “in isolation from the humanitarian tragedies unfolding around us.”\\n\\n“As we speak, the Palestinian people are facing an immediate threat to their lives and well-being,” King Abdullah said. “In a region already on the front lines of climate change, the massive destruction of war makes the environmental threats of water scarcity and food insecurity even more severe.”\\n\\nThe more than two million Palestinians trapped in Gaza have spent much of the past two months searching desperately for food and water as the Israeli military laid siege to the territory, which is run by Hamas, the armed group that led the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel that killed around 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities.\\n\\nAs the war threatens to metastasize into a wider regional conflict, Jordan, which borders Israel and the West Bank, is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to spillover. Much of the country’s population is of Palestinian descent, and fury toward Israel and the United States has swept across the Middle East since the outbreak of the war.\\n\\nSpeaking at the climate summit, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey condemned the Israeli military campaign as a “war crime.”\\n\\n“While we are here expressing our views on the climate crisis, it is impossible not to touch upon the humanitarian crisis taking place in the Palestinian territories close to us,” he said.\\n\\nThe president of Iraq, Abdul Latif Rashid, also called for protections for civilians and said he supported Palestinians’ “right to self-determination.”\\n\\nTheir remarks stood out partly for their setting: The summit’s host, the United Arab Emirates, led a push for Arab countries to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 in an American-brokered deal called the Abraham Accords. The Emirati government has maintained those ties throughout the war, even as the Israeli military campaign sparked grief and anger among Emirati citizens.\\n\\nOn social media, Mr. Herzog shared photographs from the sidelines of the summit. He met with world leaders, including the Emirati president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, and shook hands with the Qatari ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, whose country had mediated the cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\\n\\nIt was unclear whether Mr. Herzog and Mr. Abbas would speak on Saturday as the summit continues.']\n",
      "['UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief warned Monday that the world is failing to address the “existential threat” from global warning and announced that he will convene a “Climate Action Summit” in September to accelerate an urgent response to the climate crisis.\\n\\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the “non-negotiable” price of entry to the summit for leaders from governments, business, cities and regions, civil society and finance, will be “new, credible climate action to accelerate the pace of change.”\\n\\n“No exceptions. No compromises,” he told a year-end news conference. “There will be no room for back-sliders, green-washers, blame-shifters or repackaging of announcements of previous years.”\\n\\nGuterres said the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) “is gasping for breath” and “will soon disappear” as the gap between actual greenhouse gas emissions and the amount allowing the target to be met keeps growing.\\n\\nHe said the summit will take place alongside “a crucial gathering of world leaders” during their annual September gathering at the U.N. General Assembly to discuss lagging efforts to meet the 17 U.N. goals with 169 specific targets to eradicate global poverty and hunger, achieve gender equality, improve living standards and take urgent action to combat climate change, all by 2030.\\n\\nGuterres said it will be “very similar probably” to the first Climate Action Summit that he convened in September 2019 where only those with “concrete proposals” were invited.\\n\\nAt that meeting, after an emotional appeal from then 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, leaders from 66 countries promised more ambitious climate goals to prevent a warming world from reaching even more dangerous levels and 30 swore to be carbon neutral by midcentury. But the leaders and outside experts said it wasn’t enough to stop global warming.\\n\\nGuterres blamed governments for this failure, saying “national climate plans are falling woefully short,” though he acknowledged some steps have been taken to shift the global economy away from the fossil fuel use that is largely to blame for heating up the planet.\\n\\nThe U.N. chief said he will keep pushing for what he called “a Global Solidarity Pact, in which all big emitters make an extra effort to reduce emissions this decade in line with the 1.5-degree goal and ensure support for those who need it.”\\n\\n“I have pulled no punches on the imperative for all of us to confront this existential threat,” Guterres said. “And I will not relent.”\\n\\n___\\n\\nJordans reported from Berlin.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Paul Ellis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\\n\\nBefore it started, the United Nations global climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26 was billed by its chief organizer as the “last, best hope” to save the planet.\\n\\nHalfway through, optimistic reviews of its progress noted that heads of state and titans of industry showed up in force to start the gathering with splashy new climate promises, a sign that momentum was building in the right direction.\\n\\nThe pessimistic outlook? Gauzy promises mean little without concrete plans to follow through. The Swedish activist Greta Thunberg accused the conference of consisting of a lot of “blah, blah, blah.”\\n\\nOn Saturday, diplomats from nearly 200 countries struck a major agreement aimed at intensifying efforts to fight climate change, by calling on governments to return next year with stronger plans to curb their planet-warming emissions and urging wealthy nations to “at least double” funding by 2025 to protect the most vulnerable nations from the hazards of a hotter planet.\\n\\nHere’s a look at some key takeaways from the 26th annual United Nations climate change summit.\\n\\nTime for action is running out\\n\\nThe agreement established a clear consensus that all nations need to do much more, immediately, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.\\n\\nWhen the conference opened the U.N. Secretary General, António Guterres, said the top priority must be to limit the rise in global temperatures to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold, scientists have warned, beyond which the risk of calamities like deadly heat waves, water shortages and ecosystem collapse grows immensely. (The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.)\\n\\n“The reality is you’ve got two different truths going on,” Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said last week. “We’ve made much more progress than we ever could’ve imagined a couple years ago. But it’s still nowhere near enough.”\\n\\nThe agreement outlines specific steps the world should take, from slashing global carbon dioxide emissions nearly in half by 2030 to curbing emissions of methane, another potent greenhouse gas. And it sets up new rules to hold countries accountable for the progress they make — or fail to make.\\n\\nThe environment minister of the Maldives, Shauna Aminath, said the latest text lacked the “urgency” that vulnerable countries like hers required. “What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time,” she said.\\n\\nWho needs to cut and how much?\\n\\nThe final agreement leaves unresolved the crucial question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its emissions over the next decade.\\n\\nRich countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and much of western Europe, account for just 12 percent of the global population today but are responsible for 50 percent of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years.\\n\\nPresident Biden and European leaders have insisted that countries like India, Indonesia and South Africa need to accelerate their shift away from coal power and other fossil fuels. But those countries counter that they lack the financial resources to do so, and that rich countries have been stingy with aid.\\n\\nA decade ago, the world’s wealthiest economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. But they have fallen short by tens of billions of dollars annually. The COP26 agreement still leaves many developing countries without the funds they need to build cleaner energy and cope with increasingly extreme weather disasters.\\n\\nThe call for disaster aid and regulation increases\\n\\nOne of the biggest fights at the summit in Glasgow revolved around whether — and how — the world’s wealthiest nations, which are disproportionately responsible for global warming to date, should compensate poorer nations for the damages caused by rising temperatures.\\n\\nCalls for this fund, an issue called “loss and damage,” is separate from money to help poorer countries adapt to a changing climate. Loss and damage is a matter of historic responsibility, its proponents say, and would pay for irreparable losses, such as the disappearance of national territory, culture and ecosystems.\\n\\nThe Paris agreement in 2015 urged clearer rules on how to allow polluting companies and countries to buy and trade permits to lower global emissions, but the extremely dense and technical subject continued as a topic of discussion well into Saturday in Glasgow.\\n\\nNegotiators announced a major deal on how to regulate the fast-growing global market in carbon offsets, in which one company or country compensates for its own emissions by paying someone else to reduce theirs. One of the thorniest technical issues is how to properly account for these global trades so that any reductions in emissions aren’t overestimated or double-counted.\\n\\nVulnerable countries insist that rich nations should grant them a share of proceeds from carbon market transactions to help them build resilience to climate change. The United States and the European Union have opposed doing so, but island nations in particular want a mechanism to ensure that carbon trading leads to an overall reduction in global emissions.\\n\\n“We want a credible market that will deliver reductions in emissions, not just a free pass for countries to buy cheap credits offshore to meet their national requirements,” said Ian Fry, a negotiator for the Solomon Islands, an archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nOther international agreements came out of the summit\\n\\nU.S. and China : The two countries announced a joint agreement to do more to cut emissions this decade, and China committed for the first time to develop a plan to reduce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The pact between the rivals, which are the world’s two biggest polluters, surprised delegates to the summit. The agreement was short on specifics and while China agreed to “phase down” coal starting in 2026, it did not specify by how much or over what period of time.\\n\\nDeforestation : Leaders of more than 100 countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and the United States, vowed to end deforestation by 2030. The agreement covers about 85 percent of the world’s forests, which are crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing the pace of global warming. Some advocacy groups criticized the agreement as lacking teeth, noting that similar efforts have failed in the past.\\n\\nMethane : More than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas, 30 percent by the end of this decade. The pledge was part of a push by the Biden administration, which also announced that the Environmental Protection Agency would limit the methane coming from about one million oil and gas rigs across the United States.\\n\\nIndia: India joined the growing chorus of nations pledging to reach “net zero” emissions, setting a 2070 deadline to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. One of the world’s largest consumers of coal, India also said that it would significantly expand the portion of its total energy mix that comes from renewable sources, and that half of its energy would come from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030.\\n\\nThe different faces of climate action\\n\\nThere was a clear gender and generation gap at the Glasgow talks. Those with the power to make decisions about how much the world warms in the coming decades are mostly old and male. Those who are angriest about the pace of climate action are mostly young and female.\\n\\nMalik Amin Aslam, an adviser to the prime minister of Pakistan, scoffed at some of the distant net zero goals being announced during the conference, including India’s: “With an average age of 60, I don’t think anyone in the negotiating room would live to experience that net zero in 2070,” he said.\\n\\nOn the first day of the conference, Greta Thunberg joined scores of protesters on the streets outside the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow. Throughout the two-week conference she and other young climate activists — including Vanessa Nakate, Dominika Lasota and Mitzi Tan — made numerous appearances at protests.\\n\\nMs. Thunberg told the BBC in an interview ahead of the summit that she had not been officially invited to speak. She added that she thought the organizers had not invited a lot of young speakers because they “might be scared that if they invite too many ‘radical’ young people then that might make them look bad,” she said, using air quotations.\\n\\nJust holding the talks during the pandemic posed a challenge\\n\\nThe climate summit, which was delayed last year, is one of the biggest international gatherings held during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nMany summit participants traveled from countries where vaccines are still not widely available. Globally, fewer than half of all adults have been vaccinated against Covid-19, illustrating the inequities of vaccination. Travel and quarantine restrictions meant additional costs in both time and money for lodging, which made the trip impossible for some.\\n\\nAnd some participants, like President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, decided against traveling at all.\\n\\nPartway through, conference organizers issued a letter of apology to participants for the long lines and video difficulties, saying that planning around Covid restrictions has been challenging. Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the U.N. climate body, asked attendees to “bear with us” as organizers grappled with the complex arrangements, like ensuring that all those entering the venue tested negative for the coronavirus, and enforcing controls on the number of people in meeting rooms.']\n",

      "['Scientists have recently managed to maintain quantum coherence in a molecular qubit for over one hundred nanoseconds at room temperature, hinting at potential breakthroughs in quantum computing.\\n\\nQuantum computers could revolutionize information technology by changing the paradigm of computing. This is attributed to their basic units, called qubits, which can exist in any combination of states, unlike classical bits constrained to a definite value of 1 or 0. Due to this infinite variety of qubit states, a quantum computer should be able to easily handle computational problems that would take a conventional computer trillions of years to solve.\\n\\nScientists have successfully created qubits from particles such as photons, atoms, individual electrons, or even a superconducting loop. However, creating a qubit is one thing, building a working quantum computer out of thousands or even millions of qubits is an entirely different challenge, and attempts thus far have been fraught with substantial difficulties.\\n\\nFor a quantum computer to work, it is necessary to establish and manipulate subtle quantum interactions among multiple qubits — a state known as entanglement. However, for this to work, the qubits themselves need to remain stable or “coherent”, which means keeping it in a well-defined quantum state. The problem is, coherence is difficult to maintain as it easily crumbles when qubits interact with their surroundings — even radiation from space can throw them.\\n\\nTo solve this, a team of Japanese researchers led by Nobuhiro Yanai, associate professor at Kyushu University, has engineered a stable qubit using a special structure called a metal-organic framework. This structure involves combining pentacene molecules (made up of five connected benzene rings) with zirconium ions and organic dicarboxylate ligands. The pentacene molecules act like bridges, linking the ligands and ions together into a framework made up of both organic molecules and metal ions–hence the name.\\n\\nThe role of the qubit was played by a pair of neighboring pentacene molecules, which were coupled and exist within five different quantum states achieved by irradiating the metal-organic framework with various wavelengths of microwave radiation.\\n\\nThe metal-organic framework’s nanoscale voids offer the pentacene molecules a degree of freedom, but ultimately restricts their full movement under the radiation’s influence, ensuring they formed a desired quantum state and remained trapped in it for a significant amount of time.\\n\\n“The metal-organic framework in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate [pentacene molecules],” said Yanai in a press release. “Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable [them] to rotate, but at a very restrained angle.”\\n\\nThe most important result of the study was that the team could maintain coherence for more than a hundred nanoseconds at room temperature, whereas previously this could only be achieved in similar systems at incredibly cold temperatures of about -200 degrees Celsius. At such temperatures, it was possible to maintain coherence only in photonic qubits, but in addition to needing such extreme conditions to operate, quantum computers using these photon qubits suffer from photon leakage.\\n\\nMaintaining cryogenic temperatures is not only expensive but complicates the entire computing setup. Thus, creating a stable qubit that operates at room temperature is an impressive and practical achievement.\\n\\nLooking ahead, the scientists are optimistic about extending coherence for even longer periods. They believe that by designing improved metal-organic frameworks and identifying more suitable molecules for qubits, they can push the boundaries further.\\n\\n“It will be possible to generate quintet […] state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable metal-organic framework structures,” concluded Yanai. “This can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing.”\\n\\nReference: Akio Yamauchi et al, Room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework, Science Advances (2024), DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\\n\\nFeature image credit: geralt on Pixabay']\n",
      "[\"Microsoft and Quantinuum Crack the Code (Partially)\\n\\nThe Road to Quantum Supremacy\\n\\nQuantum computing hopefuls, Microsoft and Quantinuum , have announced a significant breakthrough in creating reliable quantum computers. This advancement brings the dream of commercially viable quantum computing a step closer.The race to develop functional quantum computers is intensifying. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google (through Alphabet), and IBM are battling each other and even nation-states to harness the power of quantum mechanics.These machines promise processing speeds far exceeding traditional silicon-based computers, potentially enabling scientific breakthroughs that would take millions of years on current technology.The core building block of a quantum computer, the qubit, is both powerful and sensitive. While it offers incredible processing potential, even minor disturbances can cause data errors. To overcome this hurdle, researchers often use more physical qubits than needed and then employ error-correction techniques to create a smaller number of reliable, functional qubits.Microsoft and Quantinuum claim to have cracked the error-correction code to some extent. By applying Microsoft's error-correction algorithm to Quantinuum's physical qubits, they were able to generate four reliable qubits from a pool of 30 physical ones. According to Microsoft's Jason Zander, this represents the best ratio of functional qubits to physical qubits ever achieved.Their efforts yielded impressive results. The system successfully ran over 14,000 experiments without a single error, boasting an 800x improvement over previous records. Microsoft plans to integrate this technology into its cloud computing platform within the coming months.While the ideal number of reliable qubits needed to outperform classical supercomputers is estimated to be around 100, neither company offered a timeframe for achieving this milestone using their new technique. However, Ilyas Khan, Quantinuum's chief product officer, expressed optimism, suggesting this breakthrough could shave at least two years off the previous timeline.This development marks a significant leap towards practical quantum computing, paving the way for a future where these powerful machines can revolutionize scientific research and problem-solving across various fields.\", 'Scientists at Oxford University Physics have achieved a major breakthrough in quantum computing, ensuring unprecedented security and privacy for individuals and companies. This advancement is poised to revolutionize cloud-based quantum computing, potentially opening the doors to millions for harnessing its full power.\\n\\nQuantum computing, with its potential to transform services across various sectors such as healthcare and financial services, operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional computing, offering significantly enhanced capabilities. However, concerns regarding the stability of quantum computing in controlled conditions and the effectiveness of current security and encryption systems have been a hurdle to its widespread adoption.\\n\\nLeading providers of cloud-based services, including Google, Amazon, and IBM, have been offering quantum computing elements separately. Yet, ensuring the security and privacy of customer data has been a critical prerequisite for scaling up its use and enabling the development of new applications. The recent study by Oxford University Physics researchers addresses these critical challenges.\\n\\nProfessor David Lucas, co-head of the Oxford University Physics research team and lead scientist at the UK Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub, expressed the significance of their achievement, stating, \"We have shown for the first time that quantum computing in the cloud can be accessed in a scalable, practical way which will also give people complete security and privacy of data, plus the ability to verify its authenticity.\"\\n\\nThe researchers\\' approach, known as \"blind quantum computing,\" establishes a secure connection between two distinct quantum computing entities, potentially allowing individuals at home or in an office to access a cloud server in a completely secure manner. Importantly, their innovative methods hold the potential to be scaled up for large-scale quantum computations.\\n\\nDr. Peter Drmota, the lead researcher of the study, highlighted the implications of their work, stating, \"Using blind quantum computing, clients can access remote quantum computers to process confidential data with secret algorithms and even verify the results are correct, without revealing any useful information. Realizing this concept is a big step forward in both quantum computing and keeping our information safe online.\"\\n\\nThe system devised by the researchers involves a fiber network link between a quantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, enabling blind quantum computing over a network. The researchers utilized a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this, ensuring real-time compliance with the algorithm for every computation.\\n\\nProfessor David Lucas emphasized the urgency of addressing privacy and security concerns in the era of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, stating, \"As quantum computers become more capable, people will seek to use them with complete security and privacy over networks, and our new results mark a step change in capability in this respect.\"']\n",
      "['Experts hate to be wrong. When I first started writing about the public’s hostility toward expertise and established knowledge more than a decade ago, I predicted that any number of crises—including a pandemic—might be the moment that snaps the public back to its senses. I was wrong. I didn’t foresee how some citizens and their leaders would respond to the cycle of advances and setbacks in the scientific process and to the inevitable limitations of human experts.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic, in particular, would prove the perfect crucible for accelerating the decline of faith in experts. Paranoia and appeals to ignorance have long been part of the American political environment, but they were especially destructive at a time when the U.S. was riven by partisan hostility. The pandemic struck at multiple political and cultural weaknesses within the edifice of American life: A mysterious disease—from China, no less, a nation that typically serves as a source of American anxiety—forced citizens to rely on the media, including outlets that many of them already distrusted, for scattered pieces of information from white-jacketed experts and relatively unknown government officials.\\n\\nMany elected leaders, especially at the national level, failed, in fact, to lead. The dysfunction of President Donald Trump’s administration, on COVID-19 and on so many other issues, has been amply documented in numerous books and articles. Despite the undeniable success of Operation Warp Speed, the government’s crash program to work with private industry to develop a vaccine in record time, Trump and his people have much to answer for—including the hesitancy they engendered among Americans to take the very vaccines that his administration helped develop.\\n\\nThe road to America’s pandemic meltdown, however, did not begin with Trump. When the coronavirus arrived, a significant number of Americans were already primed by the media, their political leaders, and their own stubborn narcissism to reject expert advice during a crisis. The collapse of gatekeeping authority in the media, the explosion of worthless online sources, the emergence of celebrity pseudo-experts, and the unwarranted self-confidence of millions of people who believed that they could simply “do their own research,” as the internet mantra has it, all combined to make a brutal outbreak of disease even more deadly.\\n\\nRead: The coronavirus-denial movement now has a leader\\n\\nNevertheless, where the death of expertise is concerned, the scientific community and its allies in the public-policy arena made two fundamental mistakes early on. One is that they tried to take the place of elected officials: They issued guidance and policy instructions while trying to fill the vacuum left by poor leadership in Washington, D.C., and other regions of the United States. And at the height of the lockdowns, doctors and local authorities in some cities made a nakedly political calculation about whether and when their ostensibly firm pandemic restrictions could be ignored.\\n\\nMasks and lockdowns were among the most divisive pandemic measures. As usual, Trump was resolutely ignorant and self-centered. He and his movement coalesced around depicting such public-health measures as symbols of government autocracy. At a July 2020 White House meeting, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, advised him to advocate for mask mandates, which at that point even most Republicans supported. Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, objected. “We can’t do the masks,” he told the president. “The base will just turn on you.” Trump sided with Meadows.\\n\\nBut many of Trump’s opponents themselves adopted a blinkered insistence on such mandates as their own version of political signaling. In an already polarized environment, each side hoisted their flags and charged into battle—with scant regard for evidence or expert advice.\\n\\nThe scientists unwisely stepped into this mess, with predictable results. The American public has little tolerance for nuance or complexity, and the recommendations on mask wearing were difficult to parse and changed over time. What kind of mask would work best? (An N-95 respirator—if worn correctly.) Would cloth masks work? Bandannas, maybe? (Probably not very well.) Should masks be worn everywhere? Indoors, outdoors—even at home?\\n\\nThe public wanted clear and unambiguous answers that the scientists could not give them: yes or no, safe or unsafe, on or off. Woefully unaccustomed to explaining complicated issues to ordinary citizens, they made a hash of the messaging and simply tried to push for masks as a generic measure, until many Americans—even those who wanted to be cooperative—gave up.\\n\\nAdvocates for lockdowns and strict masking rules argued that they had the stronger point in a time of uncertainty. Such prophylactic measures, they contended, even if ragged and inconsistent, were better than flatly ignoring manifest public-health dangers. But “following the science” means following all of the science, and these rigid, dogmatic responses downplayed the fact that the science was also showing that some COVID-19 policies did, in fact, carry a destructive price. The lockdowns, as the COVID Crisis Group (a nonpartisan collection of scholars and scientists) noted later, were not a solution but a “sledgehammer” that took the place of better preparation and resulted from an inability to agree on almost anything else.\\n\\nThe subsequent extended closure of public spaces in the U.S. produced deep social and economic wounds, but the controversy over when to reopen schools was a particularly important area of expert failure. The closures of educational institutions went on too long in many parts of the country, resulting in emotional and intellectual damage to American students.\\n\\nRead: Paging Dr. Hamblin: Why didn’t America’s shutdowns work?\\n\\nMany progressives, however, bitterly contested growing evidence both that in-person schooling was relatively safe and that school closures had created catastrophic learning loss. This was in many cases a stubborn reaction, a kind of polar opposition to the obdurate people on the right who dismissed almost all pandemic measures as oppression. For the left, as the New York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait later noted, “the evidence did eventually win out,” while the Republicans descended into an “epistemic disaster” that persists to this day.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the evidence did not win out in time to prevent harm, especially in schools. Public-school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom, but many teachers were hesitant, and one of their largest unions, the American Federation of Teachers, and its leader, Randi Weingarten, were resistant to the point of militancy. Weingarten warned in July 2020 that the AFT might even support strikes if teachers were forced back to the classroom.\\n\\nThe pressure from the AFT had a clear effect on national policy subsequently. Within weeks of taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden backpedaled on his campaign promises to open schools. According to my Atlantic colleague Franklin Foer, Biden acquiesced to writing off the rest of the academic year as “the price of peace” with the union.\\n\\nThe teachers’ concerns were understandable, but the intransigence of some of their union leaders did significant harm to their already battered standing. Meanwhile, over those same months, another expert community—this time, medical professionals—needlessly inflicted a grievous wound on the impartiality of their own expertise.\\n\\nOn May 25, 2020, a white police officer murdered a Black man named George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis. The incident was captured on video and protests soon broke out all over America.\\n\\nDoctors and scientists had a problem on their hands. Floyd’s killing produced an outpouring of grief and anger: Americans wanted to gather, they wanted to support one another, they wanted to vent their fury, and they wanted to shout their demands for justice into the face of their government. And yet because of COVID-19 restrictions, most Americans could not congregate in public. They could not go to church or sing in a choir. They could not celebrate their marriages, bury their dead, or even, in some areas, meet outdoors for a picnic. Schoolchildren were still trapped in their homes.\\n\\nAmerica’s cities were beginning to boil, and public-safety officials faced a no-win situation: If states and localities tried to suppress the demonstrations, their directions would be ignored. But if they allowed the protests, they were admitting that the pandemic restrictions were capricious rules that could bend in the political wind. How could one cause be important enough to allow thousands upon thousands of people to gather in close proximity, while all other citizens were told that their rights—including their freedom to worship and to engage in peaceful assembly—were secondary to the needs of public health and that they must stay home?\\n\\nRead: Facing a COVID-19 resurgence and unable to act\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci was at the time the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the U.S. government’s main public-health spokespeople. He would later enter right-wing demonology caricatured as a leftist authoritarian, but in June 2020 he gave one of the most diplomatic and sensible answers to be found among the scientists:\\n\\nIt’s a difficult situation. We have the right to peacefully demonstrate and the demonstrators are exercising that right … It’s a delicate balance because the reasons for demonstrating are valid and yet the demonstration itself puts oneself at an additional risk. The only thing we can do as public-health officials is to keep warning people to be careful. And if you are going to go out, please make sure you wear a mask and you keep the mask on at all times.\\n\\nOther doctors, however, were eager to show solidarity with the protests. In June 2020, more than 1,200 medical professionals signed an open letter supporting the demonstrations, casting Floyd’s death as a health menace on the same level as the pandemic. “Infectious disease and public health narratives adjacent to demonstrations against racism must be consciously anti-racist, and infectious disease experts must be clear and consistent in prioritizing an anti-racist message,” they wrote. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.”\\n\\nNoble if stilted rhetoric, but even people who empathized with the protesters had to notice that the previous strict prohibitions on gathering were now, for the sake of an important political cause, apparently negotiable. According to The Washington Post, Ranu S. Dhillon, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard Medical School, characterized the protests as risky but necessary—just like working in a nursing home or grocery store, an approach that showed how out of touch many professionals were with ordinary people who were afraid to visit elderly relatives or go to the market.\\n\\nThe available evidence does not so far suggest that the protests created a major surge in COVID-19 infections. But to argue that the sudden reversal in public-health advice did not result in more infections is a post hoc rationalization—and, for experts, a trap.\\n\\nAt the time, the medical guidance was clear that people should not gather in large groups or be in proximity, and certainly not while singing and shouting. If doctors believed that the risks of such gatherings could be mitigated with masks or by being outdoors, they should have already been pressing for the lifting of the strictest measures everywhere, with the same advice they gave protesters. But if they were still holding to the theories that underpinned the lockdowns—and especially the school closures—then their approval of the demonstrations meant they were consciously setting aside those concerns in the name of a political cause with which they agreed.\\n\\nEither way, they were acting as advocates rather than scientists. In the words of the environmental journalist Peter M. Sandman, they “clearly damaged the credibility of public health as a scientific enterprise that struggles to be politically neutral.”\\n\\nThe global pandemic emergency is formally over, and the experts are still assessing what they did right and wrong—as they should. But in the U.S., the political damage from the coronavirus wars remains. The most intrusive measures, including lockdowns and masking, are long gone. For most Americans, especially the elderly and other vulnerable groups, avoiding the most serious consequences of COVID-19 has become chiefly a matter of getting vaccinated and staying current on booster shots, as they would with flu and pneumonia.\\n\\nAnd yet, the U.S. still lags the rest of the developed world in protection against COVID-19. According to the CDC’s most up-to-date data, from 2023, some 70 percent of Americans received an initial vaccination, but fewer than 20 percent have had any booster. The rates are much better among people over 65, who—for various reasons, including their awareness of the disease’s increased danger for their age group—are more attentive to getting vaccinated.\\n\\nThe ultimate numbers, however, obscure the deep political divisions over vaccination, preventive measures, and science itself. A New York Times/Siena poll in 2023 found that nearly 70 percent of likely Republican voters would trust “the common sense of ordinary people” over “the knowledge of trained experts.” (In a Pew poll a year earlier, 51 percent of Americans said that public-health officials had done an excellent or good job at managing the pandemic, but that number was anchored by the 72 percent of Democrats who felt that way; only 29 percent of Republicans agreed.)\\n\\nTrump, of course, has continued his crude deployment of ignorance and fear in his second bid to regain the American presidency. When new variants of the virus began to spread in the summer of 2023, Trump released a video decrying the “tyrants” who were going to impose new pandemic mandates. “We will not comply,” he said, defying measures that did not actually exist. Fortunately, most people in the United States now have some level of immunity, and governments at all levels have learned a great deal about monitoring and treating the disease.\\n\\nNonetheless, as the COVID Crisis Group noted in 2023, “one key predictor of infections and total COVID deaths” in each state during the pandemic “was the share of people that voted for President Trump in the 2020 presidential election.” Or, as a member of the group remarked in an overview of the pandemic’s course and the American lives lost, “Trump was a comorbidity.”\\n\\nJay Varma: The public-health calculus has shifted\\n\\nThe experts failed at some important points, especially in the early days of the pandemic, but much of what the public believed to be failure was better described as science—the way that knowledge itself is developed as experts worked through a new problem with limited data. They argued and tested competing explanations and solutions. Such debates and discussions, along with the inevitable costs of trial and error during a time of emergency, are the normal processes of scientific investigation. But America’s political environment in 2020, poisoned by ignorance and rigid tribalism, virtually guaranteed that almost all aspects of the pandemic response—both failures and successes—would become divisive and partisan issues.\\n\\nExperts are fallible human beings, and they will sometimes give poor advice or make mistakes. But an advanced society and its government cannot do without them, no matter what a significant number of Americans seem to believe. To ignore expert advice is simply not a realistic option: Policy making is complex, and citizens have some responsibility to stay informed about issues that directly affect their own well-being. Experts always need to remember that they are the servants, not the masters, of a democratic society and a republican government. But as James Madison presciently warned, if citizens are to be the authors of their own fate, they must first equip themselves with knowledge, and then practice the civic virtue based on reason and cooperation that makes an informed democracy possible.\\n\\nBefore the next crisis—and there will always be another—citizens, experts, and policy makers have to engage in a difficult debate about the role of experts and educated elites in American democracy. For now, such possibilities have been thwarted by the partisan combat that erupted after the coronavirus pandemic. I still have confidence that we can, at some point, embrace the reality-based understandings we once accepted as obvious: Chief among them is that although every single vote in a democracy is as equally valid as every other, every single opinion is not.\\n\\nAmerica needs to reestablish new rules for productive engagement between the educated elites and the society they serve. But after the political events and natural disasters of the past decade, the creation of a more productive relationship between the experts and the public is going to be a challenge, and it will require time. The sooner the better, because the clock, as always, is counting down to the next unknown disaster.\\n\\nThis essay is adapted from a new edition of the author’s book The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters .', 'Plastic pollution may have met its match: The saliva of wax worms NBC\\n\\nThiel, Bezos and Zuckerberg join parade of insiders selling tech stocks FT\\n\\nClimate\\n\\n#COVID19\\n\\nThousands of disabled people died after ‘Covid treatment withheld’, inquiry to probe iNews.

Unfortunately, this change was not well recognized by the public and as many as 58% answered they were not aware of the relaxed policy in a November 2022 survey . The television news, and newspapers at that time [i.e., official propaganda] were welcoming life without masks again, especially when the notoriously hot and humid summer season in Japan was approaching. The subsequent 7th surge, however, was the most severe surge since the pandemic was declared and Japan had the world’s worst record for 10 consecutive weeks during July and September 2022 according to the WHO report [11]. This surge frightened people [My goodness me, why?] and they voluntarily continued to practice masking, though the government mask-wearing policy was left relaxed during the 7th surge.\\n\\nAnd letting the cat out of the bag:\\n\\nOther than the 7th surge, extreme mask affinity which could be referred [indeed it could, but by whom?} to as “mask dependence” developed after 3 years of daily masking practice is also a contributing factor.\\n\\n“Seatbelt dependence,” “water treatment dependence”, “manual safety dependence,” “traffic light dependence”….\\n\\nAwaiting a decision on new research regulations, scientists pen dueling articles to shape ‘gain-of-function’ policies Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

Policymakers Seem Afraid to Say So. It started by saying:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt. Unfortunately, many elected leaders and public health officials have held on far too long to the hypothesis that natural immunity offers unreliable protection against covid-19 — a contention that is being rapidly debunked by science.\\n\\nThese three sentences have an interesting relationship, don’t they?\\n\\nWe’ll Have Herd Immunity by April\\n\\nI’ll return to them in a bit, but first let’s flashback to February 2021. 450,000 Americans died of COVID in in the pandemic’s first year, overwhelming hospitals and morgues. The worst wave, where over 3,000 Americans died per day, was just receding. The virus was just 1 year-old, and it had given us plenty of reasons to respect it so far.\\n\\nNot everyone felt that way.\\n\\nOn February 18th, Dr. Markary authored an article titled We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April. He was very confident about this new virus. “Experts should level with the public about the good news,” he said. He said:\\n\\nSome medical experts privately agreed with my prediction that there may be very little Covid-19 by April but suggested that I not to talk publicly about herd immunity because people might become complacent and fail to take precautions or might decline the vaccine. But scientists shouldn’t try to manipulate the public by hiding the truth…Herd immunity is the inevitable result of viral spread and vaccination. When the chain of virus transmission has been broken in multiple places, it’s harder for it to spread—and that includes the new strains.\\n\\nThen in March, he authored an article titled Herd Immunity Is Near, Despite Fauci’s Denial. He said:\\n\\nAnthony Fauci has been saying that the country needs to vaccinate 70% to 85% of the population to reach herd immunity from Covid-19. But he inexplicably ignores natural immunity. If you account for previous infections, herd immunity is likely close at hand.\\n\\nIn May, Dr. Makary continued his media blitz to announce big news. He had been right. Herd immunity had arrived, and it was time to “stop living in fear”. In an article titled Don’t Buy The Fearmongering: The COVID-19 Threat Is Waning he said “On a clinical level, we simply have not seen significant re-infections at any concerning rate.” “The public-health threat is now defanged”, he added.\\n\\nIn another article titled Risk Of COVID Is Now Very Low — It’s Time To Stop Living In Fear: Doctor he said:\\n\\nCOVID cases are collapsing in front of our eyes…Yet some people want the pandemic to stretch out longer\\n\\nDuring an interview on Fox New that month, he dismissed the concerns about variants and said the main priority was to not “scare people”. “People need something to look forward to,” he said. He also had this exchange:\\n\\nQuestion: You talked about this a couple of months ago. You said look, we are two months away from herd immunity. Are we there, are we closer, is it ever going to be full realized in your estimation? Answer: Well unfortunately, we have this perception now that’s being created by some public health leaders that we reach to total eradication. And we’re not going to get to total risk elimination. That is a false goal and quite honestly it’s being used to manipulate the public. We heard today if get to 70% vaccination, then we can see restrictions. That’s dishonest. Most of the country is at herd immunity. Other parts will get there later this month… I call that herd immunity.\\n\\nI don’t remember anyone serious talking about “total risk elimination” in May 2021, though through this straw man argument, Dr. Makary sought to convince his audience that “public health leaders” were dishonest manipulators out to scare people. In contrast, he was a straight shooter, willing to tell bravely the truth- most of the country is at herd immunity.\\n\\nIn June, Dr. Makary formalized his thoughts in an article called The Power of Natural Immunity, another article that paid homage to the “power” of being infected with a potentially deadly virus. He said:\\n\\nThe news about the U.S. Covid pandemic is even better than you’ve heard… There’s ample scientific evidence that natural immunity is effective and durable, and public-health leaders should pay it heed.\\n\\nHe added:\\n\\nWith more than 8 in 10 adults protected from either contracting or transmitting the virus, it can’t readily propagate by jumping around in the population. In public health, we call that herd immunity, defined broadly on the Johns Hopkins Covid information webpage as “when most of a population is immune.” It’s not eradication, but it’s powerful.\\n\\nDr. Makary concluded:\\n\\nIt’s time to stop the fear mongering and level with the public.\\n\\nSo far this year, nearly 2.8 million cases of COVID have been reported in the U.S.\\n\\nLet’s return to those three sentences from Dr. Makary’s article Natural Immunity to Covid Is Powerful. Policymakers Seem Afraid to Say So:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt. Unfortunately, many elected leaders and public health officials have held on far too long to the hypothesis that natural immunity offers unreliable protection against covid-19 — a contention that is being rapidly debunked by science.\\n\\nWe all know what happened next.\\n\\nSince February 2021, when Dr. Makary penned We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April, around 700,000 Americans have died of COVID and millions more have been injured by it. It’s not over yet. Unfortunately, those “elected leaders and public health officials” turned out to be right. Natural immunity offers unreliable protection against COVID, and reinfections are hardly rare events. Despite the abundance and “power” of natural immunity, we still do not have herd immunity.\\n\\nDelta is downgraded to a mild seasonal virus that causes mild common cold-like symptoms.\\n\\nSo, did Dr. Makary adapt when new data proved his scientific hypothesis was incorrect? Not that I’ve seen. I have not seen him acknowledge his bizarre fetishization of the “power of natural immunity” was misplaced. I have not seen him revisit his doomed declarations of herd immunity. I have not seen him retract his unprofessional slurs that “public health leaders” were “dishonest” and trying to “manipulate the public” because they wanted the pandemic to continue.\\n\\nHe’s not alone.\\n\\nMany doctors sounded exactly like Dr. Makary in 2021. These “free-thinking” doctors also claimed that natural immunity was a “triumph,” that vaccines were a panacea for those who needed them, that variants were nothing to “panic” about, and that kid’s didn’t need the COVID vaccine because the pandemic was ending. They too disparaged anyone who disagreed as having an “addiction to doom and gloom.”\\n\\nYet, when the pandemic failed to end, these doctors just barreled on full-steam ahead as if none of that ever happened. Their confident, optimistic proclamations- most of the country is at herd immunity– were made and then instantly forgotten, without a moment’s recognition of error or the slightest expression of regret to those they smeared as “fear mongers.”\\n\\nIn fact, doctors who said the pandemic was winding down in the first half of 2021, devoted the second half of that year not to pausing their COVID commentary and reflecting on their failed forecasts, but rather by doubling down and minimizing the variants that obliterated their pollyannaish predictions. No matter what was happening on the ground, they just kept robotically repeating the exact same things they’d always said. There was always “reassuring data“. It was always time to stop “living in fear“. They were all completely predictable.\\n\\nArticles from February, July, and December 2021\\n\\nLike these doctors, Dr. Makary also failed to adapt to new data when the Delta variant arrived, wrecking his declarations of herd immunity. As it ripped through much the country, he just kept robotically repeating the exact same things he’d always said. He gave in interview in June titled Dr. Marty Makary Pans ‘Fear-Mongering’ Over Delta Variant, and in August he said:\\n\\nIf you’re one of the 99%+ of kids that are unvaccinated…those kids don’t need to worry…For most people right now, Delta is downgraded to a mild seasonal virus that causes mild common cold-like symptoms…The vaccines have been perfectly consistent against all of the variants.\\n\\nOf course, Dr. Makary and these other doctors were wrong about the Delta variant, which caused “record deaths” in many parts of the country and hit children harder than ever before, especially unvaccinated ones.\\n\\nPredictably, Dr. Makary also failed to adapt to new data when the Omicron variant arrived. As it ripped through much the country, he just kept robotically repeating the exact same things he’d always said. In December, he glorified the Omicron variant as “nature’s vaccine” and in an interview on Fox News titled Omicron Fear Fueling a ‘Second Pandemic of Lunacy’ said:\\n\\nWe’re seeing this massive new wave of fear that is fueling our second pandemic after COVID-19, which is a pandemic of lunacy, which is omicron. Now I call it omi-cold… This new scientific data from the lab explains the epidemiological data and the bedside observation of doctors that this is far more mild… and that’s why I call it omi-cold.\\n\\nOf course, Dr. Makary and these other doctors were wrong about the Omicron variant, as the articles During the Omicron Wave, Death Rates Soared for Older People and Hospitalizations Of Young Children With The Virus Surged During The U.S. Omicron Wave explain.\\n\\nAll that from the doctor who instructed others:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt.\\n\\nPublic health officials actively propagated misinformation that ruined lives and forever damaged public trust in the medical profession.\\n\\nMany people adapted to new data and relinquished their optimistic pandemic estimations when immune-evading variants arrived in the summer of 2021. These doctors did not. Minimizing COVID was a pure reflex for them. It was literally all they could do. What more could the virus have done to make them say, “OOPS! I was wrong to have said the pandemic was over“? The answer, of course, is “nothing.”\\n\\nTo my knowledge, just one of these doctors has ever acknowledged error for prematurely declaring the pandemic over. He’s also stopped doing this. Good for him. However, I can’t recall any doctor who said the pandemic ended in spring 2021 who later had the integrity to honestly reckon with the consequences of blasting out that false message in major media outlets for months on end. Million of Americans trusted these highly-credential doctors who spoke with great confidence when they said what we all wanted to hear.\\n\\nHow are these people doing today? Did all they all turn out OK?\\n\\nPredictably, instead of showing even a hint of concern about the fate of their audience and introspecting for a nanosecond, these doctors keep robotically repeating the exact same things they’ve always said. Despite his inglorious track record, Dr. Makary still fancies himself a brave truth-teller, entitled to sanctimoniously scold those dastardly “public health officials”. In an article from February 2023, ironically titled 10 Myths Told by COVID Experts — And Now Debunked, Dr. Makary spread blatant anti-vaccine falsities and continued to lavish praise on “natural immunity”. He also said this:\\n\\nPublic health officials actively propagated misinformation that ruined lives and forever damaged public trust in the medical profession.\\n\\nImagine the utter audacity, shamelessness, and lack of self-awareness it takes for the author of We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April to write that contemptible slur about people who were right about herd immunity 3-years ago. Nonetheless, I won’t disagree with him for saying:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt.\\n\\nThat’s actually a really good idea.\\n\\nArticles from February, May, June, and December 2021\\n\\nShares']\n",
      "['Should everyone with symptoms be tested?\\n\\nIf testing is low, how can a surge be prevented?\\n\\nShould we wear a mask?\\n\\nIs it time for boosters yet?\\n\\nPrecautions to be taken by the government\\n\\nNearly 7 months after the WHO withdrew the public health emergency notification for Covid-19, the virus refuses to go away. The Omicron variant has mutated into several new subvariants, with the latest, JN.1, causing a surge in Covid cases. While experts said they will wait for a few more days before calling it a new wave and there’s no need to panic, they warn that the WHO-declared “variant of interest” may not be the last on the list.Seasonal flu like influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), respiratory infections caused by adenovirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus can cause monsoon-related ailments that mimic Covid-19 symptoms, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, former WHO chief scientist, said.“It is not possible to test everyone with symptoms. We must test people hospitalized with severe respiratory infection or pneumonia,” she said.One way to predict a surge is to look for microbes in wastewater. In several countries, wastewater sample are tested to detect and report on different infections circulating in a community, Dr Subramanian Swaminathan, an infectious diseases expert at Gleneagles Global Health City, said.“Wearing a mask in closed crowded spaces like wedding halls, trains and buses is a good idea. It can prevent several air-borne illnesses including Covid,” Dr K Kolandaisamy, former director of public health, says.“But there is no need to make masks mandatory yet. Elderly, pregnant women, and people with immune deficiencies must avoid going into crowded spaces. If they do, they must wear a mask. Those with respiratory infections, colds, and cough should also wear masks in crowded spaces,” he says.Vaccines have been working well in preventing severe disease. However, waning immunity is visible. People infected earlier and those vaccinated with at least 2 doses still get infected.JN.1 has been called a “variant of interest” by the WHO because of its transmissibility. In several countries, including India, updated versions of the vaccine are already available.“The elderly, people with comorbidities and chronic medical conditions are strongly recommended to take the vaccine,” Dr S Ramasubramanian, an infectious diseases expert at Apollo Hospitals, said.The directorate of public health advised all hospitals to keep equipment ready. Hospitals have been asked to do mock drills after checking on stock of medicines, and oxygen storage, Dr TS Selvavinayagam, director of public health, said.', 'January 02, 2024 12:59 am | Updated 12:31 pm IST\\n\\nIt is four years since the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later renamed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV2) was first reported on December 31, 2019 from China. In the months which followed, it caused severe COVID-19 waves in nearly every country, across the world. Alongside, at end December or early new year, there would be news of a new variant or sub-variant, or of a surge in cases in some countries. At the end of 2021, it was an Omicron variant (BA.1.1.529), and by the end 2022, the COVID-19 case surge in China made news. Now, a new subvariant of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the JN.1, is making news.\\n\\nVirus behaviour\\n\\nThe JN.1 sub-variant of Omicron has been reported from multiple countries and designated as a variant of interest (VoI) by the World Health Organization. This has raised some concerns and caused some worries. But is it really cause for concern? The short answer is a no. The reason is that the reporting of a new variant or sub-variant is on expected lines. In fact, in May 2023, while declaring the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO had highlighted the need for continuous tracking of the virus and its variants. The rationale was simple. The pandemic is over, but SARS-CoV-2 was and is circulating in all countries and all settings and will continue to do so for long, and possibly forever. That is how most viruses behave. Therefore, there is always the possibility of some seasonal changes in the number of cases, at unpredictable intervals. A linked feature is that the genetic material of the circulating viruses — especially of the respiratory virus — keeps changing over a period. These changes in genetic structure (genome) result in the designation of new variants and sub-variants.\\n\\nSince the reporting of the novel virus in 2019, more than 1,000 subvariants and recombinant sub-lineages have been reported. Against this backdrop, the emergence of JN.1 is not surprising. However, every change in genome does not matter, and the international agencies and subject experts are on task to assess the risk. However, if mutations or genetic changes result in an alternation in the characteristics of the virus (such as higher transmission, more severe disease or immune escape from vaccine induced or natural immunity), it merits greater attention. The variants are then termed as VoI or variants of concern (VoC). At present, there is no VoC in circulation in any part of the world. On March 16, 2023, WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution had downgraded the Omicron as the ‘previous’ variants of concern. However, national and global agencies are tracking the virus and JN.1 has been designated as VoI.\\n\\nJN.1 has been designated a VoI, which means it has some genetic changes and indicative characteristics in circulating viruses which need to be monitored by the health agencies and government. Such a designation is a call to step up genomic sequencing scientific work and use data to track the virus. JN.1 is not a new virus but a sub-variant of BA.2.86, which itself is a subvariant of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Till now, there is no evidence that JN.1 causes more severe disease or causes immune escape and is, thus, not a reason for worry. In short, designating a variant as VoI does not automatically mean there is a reason to worry. Till now, there is no evidence that JN.1 is responsible for severe disease or immune escape. In fact, the waste-water surveillance in some Indian cities had indicated that the new sub-variant has circulated to a majority of the population without major change in reported or clinical cases in the way of a ‘silent wave’.\\n\\nThe vaccine response\\n\\nDoes it mean we need to get additional shots of COVID-19 vaccines? Current scientific evidence supports that vaccines and natural infection continue to provide protection from any sub-variant, though there is some possibility of a decline in protection, as time has lapsed since the last vaccination. Immunologically, the natural infections which have happened in addition to vaccine shots, have provided hybrid immunity to people in India and many countries. Therefore, there is no immediate reason to worry. There is no scientific evidence to support having a fourth shot of COVID-19 vaccines, for any age group.\\n\\nWe also need to interpret the rise in COVID-19 cases more carefully. The spike in COVID-19 cases in India could be more artificial than real. It is likely that ramped up COVID-19 testing is picking more cases. Then, some deaths are being attributed to COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that those deaths are causally linked to SARS-CoV-2. These appear to be in the individuals who were already sick and had COVID-19, as an incidental finding. The average five or six deaths in a day in India also need to be considered in perspective.\\n\\nTo put this in context, every day in India, an estimated 27,000 people die due to a range of reasons that include old age. In contrast, respiratory diseases and tuberculosis kill 50 to 60 times more people every day than COVID-19 now. We need to shift attention to preventable deaths due to many other reasons.\\n\\nAct responsibly\\n\\nYet, four years should help us to learn. The government’s COVID-19 response and actions should be more nuanced and informed by all evidence and real time data. Citizens need to act responsibly and not share unverified social media messages or forwards. Science communication from the government needs to be more interactive, and public communication messaging should be more routine and easy to understand. There is a possibility scenario where reported COVID-19 cases may increase slightly in the days ahead, or in the months ahead — as it happened in April 2023 when daily cases had spiked. However, for most circulating respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, mere transmission or an increase in cases is not an immediate concern. Right now, SARS-CoV-2 infections do not appear to change clinical outcomes in any age groups.\\n\\nHow should we respond to current or any future uptick due to SARS-CoV-2? The short answer is in the same way that we respond to any seasonal rise in cases of flu, respiratory illnesses or dengue virus. By the government increasing standard public health preventive measures such as Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza-like Illness (ILI) surveillance, waste water surveillance and improving provision of required services at health facilities. The clinical management should focus on a syndromic approach to respiratory illnesses. At the individual and community levels, there is no need to disturb the routine or change your travel or vacation plans. People with cough and cold or flu-like illness must follow good respiratory etiquette such as wearing masks in public places, covering their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and frequent handwashing, irrespective of whether it is a type of SARS-CoV-2, seasonal flu or any other respiratory illness. It is proven that the risk to children is the lowest among any age group and thus, school closure should never be considered an option in response to a COVID-19 case surge.\\n\\nIt is time we handle SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 just like any other respiratory illness. It is more of an individual health concern than a public health concern. COVID-19 is not a novel virus any more and is here to stay. But it is not a reason to worry.\\n\\nDr. Chandrakant Lahariya is a medical doctor with over 15 years of work experience with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the India Country office, the regional office for Africa, Brazzaville; and the WHO headquarters in Geneva. The views expressed are personal', 'In the wake of the surge in respiratory diseases and new JN.1 COVID sub-variant, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that the virus is evolving and changing and urged the member states to continue with strong surveillance and sequence sharing.\\n\\nThe global body also shared a video of its COVID-19 technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, who explained the reason for the recent surges and what precautions can be taken.\\n\\n\"Dr @mvankerkhove talks about the current surge in respiratory diseases #COVID19 and JN.1 subvariant. WHO continues to assess the situation. Follow WHO\\'s public health advice to keep your families and friends safe during this holiday season,\" WHO posted on X (formerly Twitter).\\n\\nMaria Van Kerkhove also took to the social media platform and said that a number of pathogens have led to the rise in respiratory diseases across the world.\\n\\n\"Respiratory diseases are increasing around the world due to a number of pathogens incl #COVID19, #flu, rhinovirus, mycoplasma pneumonia & othersSARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. JN.1 (subvariant of BA.2.86) is already a VOI and continues to increase in circulation,\" she stated.\\n\\nIn the video message, Kerkhove said that the recent surge in respiratory infections is due to multiple reasons, including increased gatherings during the holiday season and other infections.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not just COVID-19 that\\'s circulating; we have influenza, other viruses, and bacteria. In other parts of the world, we are entering the winter months, and people are starting to gather for the holiday season. And as people gather, they spend more time indoors, especially if there is poor ventilation. These pathogens that spread efficiently between people and through the air will take advantage,\" she said.\\n\\nShe further explained that the rise in COVID cases is because the virus is evolving, adding that 68 per cent of the current cases are cases of XBB sublineages and other groupings like JN.1.\\n\\n\"Covid-19 is one of the diseases that is currently on the rise, and this is again due to a number of factors; the virus SARS-Cov-2 is evolving, changing, and circulating in all countries,\" Kerkhove said.\\n\\nShe added, \"In some countries, we have these XBB sublineages, and they represent around 68 per cent or so of the sequences that are shared globally. The other grouping is BA.2.86, most notably JN.1 which causes the full spectrum, everything from asymptomatic infection. All the way to severe disease and death, similar to what we have seen with other Omicron sublineages.\"\\n\\nThe WHO expert urged the member states to continue with strong surveillance and sequence sharing so that proper steps can be taken to \"potentially modify\" the advice for the world.\\n\\nShe also advised people to get vaccinations and, in cases of infection, take clinical care.\\n\\n\"Protect yourself from infection using a number of tools. But also make sure that if you get infected, you get clinical care and get vaccinated when it\\'s your turn to prevent severe disease and death. All COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide against severe disease and death, and this includes all the circulating variants, including JN.1,\" Kerkhove said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Union Ministry of Health has initiated preparedness measures after a case of the JN.1 subvariant of COVID was found in Kerala as part of the ongoing routine surveillance conducted by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).\\n\\nA mock drill is underway in health facilities across states, evaluating public health and hospital readiness. This exercise, overseen by district collectors, commenced on December 13 and is scheduled for completion by December 18, 2023.\\n\\nWhile the majority of cases in Kerala are reported to be clinically mild, the health authorities emphasise the importance of ongoing vigilance and preparedness to effectively manage the evolving situation related to COVID-19 variants.\\n\\nThe India SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a network of Genomic Laboratories, has been actively monitoring the genomic aspects of COVID-19 in India.\\n\\nThe reported symptoms include fever, runny nose, sore throat, headache, and, in some cases, mild gastrointestinal symptoms. The health authorities highlight that most patients experience these mild upper respiratory symptoms, which typically improve within four to five days. (ANI)\\n\\nMilestone Alert!

While the original Omicron strain (BA.1) is no longer circulating, Omicron subvariants are now driving most of the country’s SARS-CoV-2 infections. Omicron was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November 2021, and cases quickly began to surface and multiply in other countries. By December of that year, Omicron was causing daily case numbers in the U.S. to skyrocket to over a million. In 2022, it had spawned a number of subvariants. In 2023, a new Omicron strain called EG.5 (nicknamed “Eris”) is the dominant strain in the U.S., and experts are monitoring another new strain called BA.2.86 (nicknamed “Pirola”).\\n\\nHow contagious is it? Omicron’s subvariants are considered to be especially efficient spreaders of the disease. The original strain of Omicron was more transmissible than Delta was. One explanation was that more than 30 of Omicron’s mutations are on the virus’s spike protein, the part that attaches to human cells, and several of those are believed to increase the probability of infection.\\n\\nSeverity: Scientists are still working to learn more about whether the current Omicron strains cause more severe disease than their predecessors. Data has suggested that the original Omicron strain was less severe, in general, than previous variants, according to the CDC. But it has also been noted that surges in cases may lead to significant increases in hospitalizations and deaths, as they did during the variant’s spread at the beginning of 2022, when the estimated death rates went as high or higher than they were at the time of the Delta variant surge in the previous autumn.\\n\\nCan vaccination prevent it? The CDC says that while breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are expected, staying up to date with vaccinations is the best protection against Omicron. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of a new fall 2023 updated COVID-19 booster against EG.5 and BA.2.86, according to the CDC. Currently, the CDC says the updated vaccine is expected to be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization from the two recent subvariants.', 'There are several things about the coronavirus epidemic that are not very well understood, or explained by the facts at hand. For example, the unexpected five-month long decline in cases in India starting in mid-September last year. An even bigger surprise has been the ferocity of the second wave that has seen the daily count of cases in India soaring to more than four lakh.\\n\\nLack of ‘Covid-appropriate behaviour’ has been cited as one of the main reasons for the rapid rise in infections from March. But that is only part of the explanation. Even during the five-month lull, the adoption of masks wasn’t universal, nor was physical distancing being strictly followed. Election rallies have also been blamed, but these do not explain the phenomenal rise in cases in states such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab or Karnataka that had no elections. In any case, the second wave had started much before the large political rallies began to take place.\\n\\nNewsletter | Click to get the day’s best explainers in your inbox\\n\\nThe newer variants\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScientists have also been examining whether biological changes in the virus had anything to do with the unprecedented surge in infections in the last two months. Viruses mutate, and mutations that help it survive and circulate better are selected. In the last few months, several new variants of the virus have been found to be circulating in the Indian population.\\n\\nA few of these have greater transmissibility, meaning they have a better ability to infect human beings. One particular variant, called B.1.617, first found in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, has received a lot of attention because of its ability to transmit at a faster rate and, possibly, also to evade the immune response. Other fast-transmitting variants, such as the one that first emerged in the United Kingdom, called B 1.1.7, that has been found to be present in large numbers in northern India, could also be the reasons for the rapid rise in cases.\\n\\nSteep rise in new cases since March Steep rise in new cases since March\\n\\nWhile scientists acknowledge that these new variants could have contributed to the surge in cases, they have reluctant to say that these are the main cause for the ferocity of the second wave. They have been maintaining that the epidemiological evidence is still not clinching enough. On Wednesday, the government, for the first time, linked the B.1.617 variant with the surge seen in some states. But it reiterated that the clinical and epidemiological correlation was still not fully established.\\n\\nNot the same everywhere\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnurag Agrawal, director of Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said while the new variants had been found to be circulating in many parts of the country, not every surge in cases could be attributed to these. Even within a state, the spread of the virus in some areas could be directly because of these faster-transmitting variants, while in others some other factor could be responsible.\\n\\n“In Maharashtra, for example, the rise in cases in the Vidarbha region can possibly be explained by the emergence of the B.1.617 variant. But this variant does not explain the surge in Mumbai. That is because this variant has not been found in adequate numbers in the Mumbai population. There, the main reason for the rise could be something else… reopening of the local trains, possibly, in the month of February,” he said.\\n\\nIn Kerala, the new variant that is predominantly in circulation is N440K. But Agrawal said the surge in Kerala could not be attributed to this. “The locations where we found this variant were not the same where the maximum cases were getting reported from. In fact, the surge was found to be the maximum in areas where the presence of this variant was the least,” he said.\\n\\nIn Punjab and Haryana, however, there is little doubt about the cause of the surge. In both the states, the UK variant is predominant. In a recent study, more than 80% of the samples taken from infected people in Punjab were found to be of this variant. Neighbouring Delhi also has a large proportion of the UK variant, but in keeping with the character of the national capital which has people coming in from across the country, nearly every variant circulating in other states has marked a presence in Delhi as well. And there are hundreds of them, most of them having little or no impact on the rise in cases.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScientists say that in most places, a surge or a decline in cases can only be explained by a combination of factors. Almost every state has one variant or the other present, but in many places these have had no role in causing the increase in cases. As one of the scientists explained, epidemics are like complex systems where very small changes in inputs, or initial conditions, can lead to dramatic and unexpected outputs. So, at some places, even a large number of wedding gatherings on a particular day could be the reason for a prolonged surge. The exponential nature of the spread of an epidemic makes this possible.\\n\\nVariants under watch\\n\\nYet, the new variants are under close watch right now. The government has already classified the B.1.617 as a ‘variant of concern’ though that tag is still to be attached to it officially by the World Health Organization. As reported by this newspaper, this particular variant has undergone further mutations, and at least three different sub-variants, named B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3, are supposed to have the potential to spread even faster, and cause bigger damage than the parent variant.\\n\\nAgrawal said these three new variants were a cause of concern. “I am worried about the B.1.617, and the three new ones emerging from it. I am worried about the UK variant, and also the South African variant. But I am not too much worried about the Brazilian variant, or the B.1.618, or even the N440K. I am currently worried only about the variants that have the potential to cause explosive rise in cases,” he said.']\n",

Year on year, gold is up 16.5%.\\n\\nInvestors who expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate are the main force driving up prices, but the surge is boosted by other factors, including central banks — led by China — buying up gold to ease reliance on US dollars.\\n\\nCentral banks see gold as a long-term store of value and a safe haven during times of economic and international turmoil.\\n\\nGold is considered a resilient investment. When interest rates fall, gold prices tend to rise, as bullion becomes more appealing than income-paying assets like bonds. Investors also regard gold as a hedge against inflation, betting bullion will retain its value when prices rise.\\n\\nThe People’s Bank of China bought gold for the 17th straight month in March, adding 160,000 ounces to bring reserves to 72.74 million troy ounces of gold, according to Reuters.\\n\\nCentral banks may want to “diversify away” from US dollars and buy gold amid geopolitical uncertainty, according to an April 9 UBS research note.

On Reddit, proud gold buyers often post threads about their stashes.\\n\\nCostco began selling gold bars online in August and silver coins in January. The company may now be selling as much as $200 million in gold and silver each month, according to an estimate by Wells Fargo. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told analysts in December that the company had sold more than $100 million of gold bars in the prior quarter.\\n\\n“The accelerating frequency of Reddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and [the company’s] robust monthly eComm sales suggests a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch,” the April 9 investment note said.\\n\\nLindahl said that “trend followers” and others jump on the rise in prices as the background begins to point to substantially higher prices over the long term.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that gold is a traditional asset to hold during political uncertainty. Voters in more than 60 countries are set to head to the polls this year, including for the US presidential election. That uptick in geopolitical and economic unpredictability underscores the precious metal’s stable value.', 'The price of gold has climbed 17% in 2024.\\n\\nShoppers are flocking to Costco for gold bars but they\\'re hardly the only ones scooping up the precious metal.\\n\\nInvestors drove gold prices to a record high on Friday, the latest surge in a 17% rally so far this year. Over that period, bullion prices have climbed more than twice as fast as the S &P 500, the index that most people\\'s 401(k)\\'s track.\\n\\nThe price gains stem from a wider trend of investors seeking out high-return assets in anticipation of interest rate cuts expected later this year, some experts told ABC News.\\n\\nA so-called momentum trade has also pushed prices higher, they added, since investors see the price of gold swell and want to share in the gains.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing a situation where people are actually increasing their risk exposure,\" Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke\\'s Fuqua School of Business who studies commodity prices, told ABC News, noting that the typical price volatility of gold resembles that of the S &P 500.\\n\\n\"You see things like the S &P 500 going up and bitcoin going up,\" Harvey added. \"Gold is part of that.\"\\n\\nCostco has generated an estimated $100 million to $200 million per month in gold bar sales, Wells Fargo said in a recent equity research note.\\n\\nWhile the price is not disclosed online to nonmembers, the product typically sells for nearly 2% above the spot price, which as of time of publication stood at $2,430 per ounce.\\n\\nThe buying spree has also taken hold at central banks, UBS said in a report last week, citing some central banks\\' desire to move away from U.S. dollars and hedge against inflation risks.\\n\\nIn January and February, central banks purchased about 64 metric tons of gold and China imported 132 metric tons from Switzerland, a gold-refinery stalwart, UBS said.\\n\\nHedge funds and other institutional investors have also bought into the gold craze in an effort to capitalize on the commodity\\'s blistering rise, Campbell said. \"That institutional pressure is pushing the price of gold up,\" he added.\\n\\nGold prices have surged despite low activity in a key instrument for everyday investors: ETFs.\\n\\nAn ETF amounts to a bucket of securities that gives investors a way to bet that an underlying asset will increase in price without purchasing that asset.\\n\\nAn ETF for gold, in turn, allows individuals to put money on the price movement of the precious metal rather than buy, lug and store the physical item.\\n\\nOver the last 10 months, however, gold ETFs have incurred a net outflow of funds, meaning that on the whole the ETFs are losing investment rather than gaining it, Harvey said. That trend, he added, suggests retail investors are not a major cause of the price increase.\\n\\nShoppers outside a Costco store in Bayonne, NJ, Dec. 9, 2023.

In addition to purchasing the gold bars on offer at some stores like Costco, investors can put funds into a variety of gold ETFs or buy shares in gold mining companies.\\n\\nIndividuals can also invest in gold futures, contracts to buy or sell gold on an agreed-upon date, which essentially amount to a bet on the movement of the price.\\n\\nInvestors should beware, however, Harvey said, noting that bullion typically generates modest returns over the period following an all-time high. UBS expects the price of gold to tick up to $2,500 by the end of the year, according to its report last week.\\n\\n\"Investing at an all-time high is very risky,\" Harvey said.\\n\\nReporters at Good Morning America contributed to this report.']\n",
      "['Human activity in a profit-driven world divided by nation-states and those who have rights and those who don’t is the primary driver of climate change. Burning fossil fuels and destroying forests have caused inestimable environmental harm by producing a warming effect through the artificial concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has risen by 50 percent in the past 200 years, much of it since the 1970s, raising in turn the Earth’s temperature by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nIndeed, since the 1970s, the decade which saw the rise of neoliberalism as the dominant economic ideology in the Western world, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90 percent. Unsurprisingly, average temperatures have risen more quickly over the past few decades, and the last 10 years have been the warmest years on record. In fact, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration analysis has confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, and all indications are that 2024 could be even hotter than 2023. In March, scientists at Copernicus Climate Change Service said that February 2024 was the hottest February, according to records going back to 1940.\\n\\nThe world is now warming faster than any point in recorded history. Yet, while the science of climate change is well established and we know both the causes and the effects of global warming, the rulers of the world are showing no signs of discontinuing their destructive activities that are putting Earth on track to becoming uninhabitable for humans. Emissions from Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s utter destruction of Gaza will undoubtedly have a significant effect on climate change. Analysis by researchers in the United Kingdom and United States reveals that the majority of global emissions generated in the first two months of the Israeli invasion of Gaza can be attributed to the aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Indeed, the destruction of Gaza is so immense that it exceeds, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II.\\n\\nFurther evidence that the rulers of the world view themselves as being separate and distinct from the world around them (in spite of the fact that all life on Earth is at risk) came during the recent CERAWeek oil summit in Houston, Texas, where executives from the world’s leading fossil fuel companies said that we should “abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas.” Who from the likes of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies gives a damn if the emissions from the burning of fossil fuels until 2050 causes millions of deaths before the end of the century? Oil and gas companies made tens of billions in annual net profit in 2023 as they continued to expand fossil fuel production.\\n\\nOf course, none of the above is to suggest that the game is over. The rulers of the world (powerful states, huge corporations, and the financial elite) are always pulling out all the stops to resist change and maintain the status quo. But common people are fighting back, and history has repeatedly shown that they will never surrender to the forces of reaction and oppression. We have seen a remarkable escalation of climate and political activism in general over the past several years — indeed, a sharp awakening of global public consciousness to the interconnectedness of challenges in the 21st century that leaves much room for hope about the future. Struggles against climate change are connected to the fight against imperialism, inequality, poverty and injustice. These struggles are not in vain, even when the odds seem stacked against them. On the contrary, they have produced some remarkable results.\\n\\nDeforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest is falling dramatically since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva came into office — a victory not only for the Brazilian people but for those across the world who care about the environment and justice. In North America, Indigenous communities scored major victories in 2023 in the struggle for conservation, protecting hundreds of thousands of acres of forest land and sacred and culturally significant sites from mining. Climate activists in Europe and the U.S. won major legal victories throughout 2023, such as the youth victory against the state of Montana. Similar climate litigation like Juliana v. United States is only expected to grow in 2024. As actor and climate activist Jane Fonda aptly put it on “Fire Drill Fridays,” a video program that was launched in 2019 by Fonda herself in collaboration with Greenpeace USA, “These lawsuits are not just legal maneuvers … but are at the crux of climate reckoning.”\\n\\nThese victories for our planet are more than enough proof that activism pays off and should be an acute reminder that the kind of transformational change we need will not start at the top. In 2018, the climate protest of a 15-year-old Swedish student captured the imagination of her own country and eventually “aroused the world,” to use the words of British broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. Indeed, just a year later, Greta Thunberg would be credited with leading the biggest climate protest in history.\\n\\nIt is grassroots environmental activism that created the political space for President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — the largest investment in clean energy and climate action in U.S. history. (It’s important to point out that the law stripped out many social and economic programs in the original draft that are critical for low-income communities and communities of color, and the law lacks a deep decarbonization pathway.) Environmental movements such as Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, and Letzte Generation have sparked a global conversation on the climate crisis and have opened up new possibilities for forcing the transition away from fossil fuels across Europe even in the face of a growing backlash by hard-line conservative and far right groups, and even as European governments crack down on climate protests.\\n\\nThe rulers of the world won’t save the planet. They have a vested interest in maintaining the existing state of affairs, whether it be oppression of the weak or continued reliance on fossil fuels. Radical political action is our only hope because voting alone will never solve our problems. Organizing communities, raising awareness and educating the public, and developing convincing accounts of change are key elements for creating real progress in politics. Indeed, as the recent history of environmental politics shows, climate activism is the pathway to climate defense.\\n\\nTired of reading the same old news from the same old sources? So are we!

The world last year lost about 37,000 square kilometers (14,000 square miles) of tropical primary forest, an area nearly as big as Switzerland and larger than the U.S. state of Maryland.\\n\\nGlobal Forest Watch is a project of the Washington-based nonprofit research organization World Resources Institute, using satellite imagery. Most of the data is compiled by University of Maryland researchers.\\n\\nDeclining forest loss in Brazil and Colombia was largely offset by greater losses elsewhere, Global Forest Watch director Mikaela Weisse told a press briefing.\\n\\n\"The world took two steps forward, two steps back,\" Weisse said.\\n\\nScientists consider tropical primary forests to be among the most precious as their lush vegetation is the most densely packed with carbon. These forests also are treasure troves of biodiversity.

That is in spite of destruction in Brazil falling 36%, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pursued aggressive conservation policies, particularly regarding the Amazon, Weisse said.\\n\\nNeighboring Colombia experienced a 49% drop in forest loss.

Deforestation refers to people permanently converting woodlands to other uses such as agriculture and is harder to measure.\\n\\nMore than 140 countries in 2021 committed to end deforestation by the end of the decade, a goal that requires huge declines in destruction each year, World Resources Institute forests director Rod Taylor said.\\n\\n\"We are far off track and trending in the wrong direction when it comes to reducing global deforestation,\" Taylor said.\\n\\nBrazil, Indonesia and Bolivia led in deforestation, followed closely by the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\nCANADA WILDFIRES OFF THE CHARTS\\n\\nTree cover loss increased 24% in all forests globally in 2022, mostly because of enormous wildfires in Canada.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nCanada\\'s forest loss of more than 80,000 square km (30,900 square miles) was three times higher than any year on record, offsetting a decline in forest loss in the rest of the world.\\n\\n\"That is one of the biggest anomalies on record,\" University of Maryland researcher Matt Hansen said.\\n\\nWhile deforestation in the tropics is a human-caused driver of climate change, the fires in Canada are more of a symptom of global warming, which leads to the hotter, drier conditions that fuel bigger blazes.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a big deal, and it\\'s a cautionary tale for climate impacts to fire,\" Hansen said.', 'Taking Charge: Three Actions to Help Combat Climate Change and Save Amazonia\\n\\nNEW YORK, Apr 4 2024 (IPS) - Climate change is the defining crisis of our time––it is the ultimate equalizer from which no one is immune. The Earth’s ecosystems are on the brink of collapse, threatening biodiversity and human societies in unprecedented ways at a global scale.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe planet is currently experiencing the warmest years on record, accompanied by a rise in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. As a “threat multiplier,” the climate crisis will continue to exacerbate already existing challenges.\\n\\nThese challenges include the alteration of 75% of the land surface and 55% of the ocean, the destruction of 32 million hectares of tropical forests between 2010 and 2015, and the thousandfold increase in species extinction rates.\\n\\nThese interconnected crises, linked to culture, education, economics, politics, and the environment, pose an urgent existential threat to humanity.\\n\\nAmazonia plays a crucial role in the global fight against climate change. Home to approximately 47 million people, 2.2 million of whom are Indigenous, and housing more than 10% of the planet’s biodiversity, it stands as the world’s largest river basin and megadiverse tropical forest.\\n\\nThis region serves as a global repository of natural resources, providing essential ecosystem services to the entire planet, including water and nutrient recycling, mediation of infectious diseases, ecotourism, and food production.\\n\\nAmazonian forests act as a colossal “air-conditioner,” reducing land surface temperatures and generating rainfall. They influence atmospheric circulation within and outside the tropics through the maintenance of aerial rivers, shaping moisture patterns across South America and contributing to the largest river discharge on Earth.\\n\\nFurthermore, Amazonia helps regulate global biogeochemical and atmospheric cycles, serving as a key buffer against climate change by storing about 150-200 billion tons of carbon in its soils and vegetation.\\n\\nYet, the region faces intense extraction processes endangering its ecosystems and peoples. Deforestation, habitat fragmentation, the overexploitation of natural resources, the expansion of large-scale infrastructure, and pollution (particularly mercury pollution) pose significant threats to Amazonia’s rich socio-biodiversity.\\n\\nMoreover, Amazonia is approximately 1.1°C warmer than it was 40 years ago, and the increased frequency of extreme climate events, like the recent record-breaking droughts, are wreaking havoc on Amazonian terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and local communities. These factors place the region’s plants and animals at high risk of extinction, undermine carbon storage and sequestration, and diminish resilience.\\n\\nIf current trends continue, Amazonia will be pushed closer to crossing a point of no return, or “tipping point,” a state in which continuous forests can no longer exist and are replaced by degraded, open canopy ecosystems.\\n\\nCrossing a tipping point would unleash potentially irreversible cascading effects, accelerating global warming, leading to decreased aerial rivers, droughts and heatwaves in central South America, and mass species extinctions.\\n\\nAddressing the climate and biodiversity crises––including by conserving Amazonia and preventing it from reaching a tipping point––requires implementing solutions that match the magnitude of the challenges faced.\\n\\nAchieving a “Living Amazon,” reaching climate stability and protecting biodiversity, requires urgent action across multiple scales to limit the rise in global temperatures by mid-century and eliminate deforestation, degradation, and wildfires in Amazonia by 2030.\\n\\nThe complexity of these crises cannot be addressed by placing the sole responsibility on governments and industry. Doing so demands both bottom-up and top-down actions, systemic transformations of our production and consumption systems, and significant restoration efforts.\\n\\nActions at the individual, household, and community levels have been proven to be more impactful than many realize. While individuals often feel hopeless about their ability to influence change on a large scale, the collective impact of individual behavior change, when adopted by billions of people, can make a decisive difference.\\n\\nHere, three impactful actions are presented that individuals can integrate into their daily lives to help combat climate change and save Amazonia.\\n\\nAction 1: Adopting Mindful Daily Habits\\n\\nSimple daily choices can influence the health of Amazonia. Minimizing food waste and switching to plant-based meals cuts emissions alleviates pressure on forests and land used for cattle ranching and animal feed production, aiding in the fight against deforestation.\\n\\nBy being aware of product origins, individuals can also support responsible sourcing practices and sustainable value chains that benefit both the environment and local communities in Amazonia. Through these actions, individuals help bolster socio-bioeconomies and empower Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs).\\n\\nAction 2: Expanding Knowledge of the Amazon\\n\\nEngaging with educational resources, like the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA)’s massive open online course, “The Living Amazon: Science, Cultures and Sustainability in Practice,” can deepen individuals’ understanding of the threats the Amazon faces and how to be part of the solution.\\n\\nAction 3: Advocate for Amazonia\\n\\nRaising awareness and advocating for policies promoting conservation, Indigenous rights and knowledge, and sustainable development are crucial to protecting Amazonia and addressing climate change. This includes advocating for the implementation of nature-based solutions, such as the Arcs of Restoration, a socio-bioeconomy of healthy standing forests and flowing rivers, and the bioindustrialization of forest products.\\n\\nSupporting political candidates who prioritize climate action, environmental conservation, and the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities can also play a critical role in the development of policies and regulations that conserve Amazonia in the years to come.\\n\\nWhen reflecting on this upcoming Earth Day (on April 22) the challenges facing the planet, it is essential to remember that systemic change begins with individual actions. The actions outlined here––adopting mindful daily habits, expanding knowledge, and advocating for Amazonia––collectively form a powerful force for positive change.\\n\\nTogether, these actions symbolize a shared commitment to a more sustainable future, where Amazonia and the planet can thrive.\\n\\nJulie Topf is Program Associate, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Gabriela Arnal is Communications Consultant, Science Panel for the Amazon.\\n\\nIPS UN Bureau']\n",
      "['Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest rose in February to the highest level on record for the month, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing the administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as it tries to undo the environmental destruction wreaked under the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro.\\n\\nGovernment satellites show that a record 322 sq km of Amazon rainforest were destroyed in February, a 62% increase on last year and the highest number for the month since records began.\\n\\nLula, who took office on 1 January this year, has pledged to end illegal logging after deforestation soared to a 15-year high during the Bolsonaro years.\\n\\nWith the environment ministry once again led by the environmentalist Marina Silva, who oversaw a sharp drop in deforestation in the same role during Lula’s first term in office, the government has reactivated the Amazon Fund, a key tool for preservation, and recreated a civil society council on the environment – both abandoned under Bolsonaro.\\n\\nSilva has also brushed off and updated a deforestation prevention and control plan that formed the backbone of her successful policies nearly two decades ago.\\n\\nThese are important steps, but “innovation is necessary, as the Amazon today is not the same as it was 10, 20 years ago”, said a Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson, Rômulo Batista.\\n\\nCrime and violence exploded under the previous government, as Bolsonaro’s disdain for the rainforest and the people who protect it emboldened criminals of all kinds, including the killers of the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Addressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist, a process which cannot happen overnight, said Batista.\\n\\n“The land grabber, the deforester, the illegal miner, they are making the most of this time to rush to cut the forest down,” Batista said.\\n\\nAfter preliminary data pointed towards the jump in destruction in February, Silva told reporters last month that loggers were working even during the Amazon’s rainy season as a “sort of revenge” against the current government’s crackdown.\\n\\nDeforestation figures are typically lower at the start of the year, as the Amazon rainy season hinders forest clearing and cloud cover means satellites are less likely to pick up on it. For this reason, analysts had cautioned against celebrating a drop in deforestation in January.', 'An estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021.\\n\\nIt was the worst year for deforestation since 2004, according to Amazon Conservation’s Monitoring of the Amazon Project (MAAP), which analyzed satellite readings from Global Forest Watch.\\n\\nThe deforestation was caused by cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.\\n\\nLast year, the Amazon saw some of the highest rates of deforestation in over a decade, due to a combination of cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects that cleared millions of acres of rainforest.\\n\\nAn estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021 and the highest figure on record except for 2004, when over 2 million hectares (about 5 million acres) were lost.\\n\\n“The 2022 deforestation data is a stark reminder that we are in a race against time for the Amazon. With deforestation rates the highest they have been since 2004, the ecological integrity of the Amazon is in jeopardy,” said Leila Salazar-López, executive director of Amazon Watch.\\n\\nThe figures come from Global Forest Watch satellite readings on deforestation and fire hotspots, which were processed and published in a report by Amazon Conservation’s Monitoring of the Amazon Project (MAAP).\\n\\nAll six countries that share the Amazon Rainforest — Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela — experienced deforestation last year, but none of them were hit as hard as Brazil. It lost a total of 1.4 million hectares (3.45 million acres) of primary forest, making it the worst year of deforestation since a historic peak between 2002 and 2005.\\n\\nFormer President Jair Bolsonaro, who left office at the end of last year, has been accused of worsening deforestation by failing to demarcate a single Indigenous territory while at the same time encouraging economic activity in the rainforest that led to some of the highest greenhouse gas emissions in years.\\n\\nSatellite readings show that a lot of the forest loss is concentrated around roads, most notably the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the states of Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia and Acre. The incomplete BR-319 highway, connecting Manaus to Porto Velho, has been criticized by conservationists who say the road will open up more areas of the rainforest to human activity.\\n\\nThe country with the second-worst deforestation was Bolivia, which saw 245,177 hectares (605,845 acres) of deforestation last year, by far the highest rate for the country on record. It was a 47% jump from 2021. Fires also directly impacted another 106,922 hectares (264,210 acres).\\n\\nThe deforestation was mostly driven by soy production in the southeast department of Santa Cruz, according to MAAP. The country has also seen a growing presence of Mennonite communities over the last two decades, with much of the land being encroached upon under questionable legal circumstances.\\n\\nPeru is also struggling with a Mennonite problem in the central Amazon. A separate MAAP report last year found that various colonies were responsible for nearly 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of deforestation. And while that and gold mining have received the most attention from policymakers and conservationists, the data suggests that much of the 144,682 hectares (357,517 acres) lost last year in Peru actually came from small-scale agriculture.\\n\\n“We focus on the most obvious cases, like the gold mining and the Mennonites,” said Matt Finer, MAAP director and senior research specialist at Amazon Conservation. “We really target those cases because they’re important, but then you still have this 90% that’s a slow death by a thousand cuts — the expansion that no one really has a handle on.”\\n\\nColombia saw 97,417 hectares (240,722 acres) of deforestation last year, making it the only country to experience a decrease from the previous year, albeit by just 2%. Most of it took place in a corridor that cuts through the central departments of Caquetá, Meta, and Guaviare. Protected areas there — such as Chiribiquete National Park and Nukak Maku Indigenous reserve — have been fending off cattle ranchers and guerrilla groups.\\n\\nEcuador, although having a much smaller piece of the Amazon than the other countries, suffered a proportionally higher spike in deforestation. It lost 18,902 hectares (46,707 acres) last year — up 80% from 2021. In addition to mining, much of that can be attributed to palm oil and other agricultural plantations.\\n\\nNow moving into 2023, there’s some concern that the El Niño warm front will exacerbate fires and increase forest loss for the year. But there’s also hope that a change in government in Brazil — now under the more environmentally friendly President Lula da Silva — will lower deforestation rates for much of the Amazon.\\n\\n“We’re optimistic about things going down in Brazil with Lula,” Finer said. “But I still think the rest of the Amazon is still much lower profile. I don’t think many aren’t paying enough attention to what’s going on.”\\n\\nBanner image: The Peruvian Amazon. Photo by Rhett A.

      "['What’s more, even intact forest with no obvious local human impacts is accumulating less carbon than it used to, as seen in some tree-census studies. A 2015 analysis6 of 321 plots of Amazon primary forest with no overt human impacts reported “a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation”. A similar study7 published in 2020 reported the same things in the Congo Basin forest — the world’s second-largest tropical jungle.\\n\\nThat’s a change from previous decades, when censuses indicated that such primary forest in the Amazon was storing more carbon. There is no consensus explanation for these slowdowns, or why primary forest was accumulating carbon. But many researchers suspect that the carbon gains in previous decades stem from the influence of extra CO 2 in the atmosphere, which can stimulate the growth of plants. In some studies that expose large forest plots to elevated CO 2 , known as free-air carbon enrichment (FACE) experiments, researchers have measured gains in biomass. But this effect lasted only a few years in one experiment8, and other studies have not yet determined whether the gains are temporary.\\n\\nAll of the forest FACE experiments have so far been conducted in temperate regions, however. And many scientists suspect that tropical forests — and the Amazon, in particular — might follow different rules. The first tropical-forest FACE experiment is finally under construction, 50 kilometres north of Manaus. Nobre says that it could help to predict whether continued increases in CO 2 will benefit the Amazon.\\n\\nFor several decades, Nobre and his students have used computer models to forecast how climate change and deforestation will affect the Amazon. The research grew, in part, from work in the 1970s showing that the Amazon forest itself helps to create the conditions that nourish it9. Moisture blowing in from the Atlantic falls as rain in the eastern Amazon and is then transpired and blown farther west. It recycles several times before reaching the Andes. A smaller or seriously degraded forest would recycle less water, and eventually might not be able to support the lush, humid forest.\\n\\nIn their 2016 study2, Nobre and several colleagues estimated the Amazon would reach a tipping point if the planet warms by more than 2.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures and if 20–25% of the Amazon is deforested. The planet is on track to reach 2.5 °C of warming by 2100, according to a report released by the United Nations last October.\\n\\nNobre now wonders whether his earlier study was too conservative. “What Luciana Gatti’s paper shows is that this whole area in the southern Amazon is becoming a carbon source.” He is convinced that, although the Amazon is not at the tipping point yet, it might be soon.\\n\\nSusan Trumbore, director of the Max Planck Institute of Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany, is not a fan of using the term tipping point, a phrase with no precise definition, to discuss the Amazon. But she says that the forest’s future is in question. “We all think of a tipping point as it’s going to happen and it’s going to happen fast. I have a feeling that it’s going to be a gradual alteration of the ecosystem that we know is coming with climate change,” she says. Regardless of whether the change will be fast or slow, Trumbore agrees with the majority of scientists who study the Amazon that it is facing serious challenges that might have global ramifications.', '\"I don\\'t think that [tipping point] is what we are seeing [yet], at least in all but the driest part of the Amazon forest,\" says Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the latest study.', 'Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\\n\\nThe study suggests that 10% to 47% of the landscape is at risk of transitioning away from rainforest by 2050 if warming and rates of deforestation aren’t dramatically curbed.\\n\\n“So many stressors are intensifying — climatic ones and land use stressors — when you combine these, they all end up causing water stress in the forest,” said Bernardo Flores, a lead author of the paper who is an ecologist and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Santa Catarina, in Florianópolis, Brazil. “It can reach a point where the forest is no longer capable of persisting.”\\n\\nThe Amazon contains about 10% of the world’s land-based biodiversity and stores incredible amounts of carbon in its dense trees. The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.\\n\\nFlores said that the changes outlined in the study are already happening but that he was optimistic they could be slowed or even halted.\\n\\n“I’m hoping in this paper, our findings will show the urgency if we don’t act within the next 30 years,” Flores said.\\n\\nThe study focuses on overlapping stressors to the Amazon, namely from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires. It describes how those factors could combine to break down the Amazon’s water and carbon cycles.\\n\\n“The Amazon is massive and maintains its own water cycle,” said Ernesto Alvarado, a research associate professor at the University of Washington’s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, who was not involved in the study. “If the balance breaks, it’s a major problem.”\\n\\nIf deforestation, wildfires, droughts and climate change reduce the amount of forested land that absorbs water, less moisture would be available to the atmosphere from plants, reducing the amount of rain to sustain the landscape.\\n\\nAbout 15% of the Amazon has already been lost, Flores said.']\n"

The Alliance is under the leadership of Macky Sall, President of Senegal, and Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain.\\n\\nIn opening remarks, Sánchez mentioned tangible results during the Alliance’s first year, including: six new countries – Australia, Colombia, the Comoros, Italy, Paraguay, and Uruguay – joining IDRA; publications such as the Global Drought Snapshot 2023 Report, launched at COP 28; and developing new financial mechanisms to leverage funds. He announced that Spain will host a high-level meeting on droughts in 2024.\\n\\nIbrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary, UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), noted that while droughts were once viewed as only affecting some regions, they are now a global threat, impacting on livelihoods and ecosystems and fueling displacement and conflicts.\\n\\nHindou Oumarou Ibrahim, speaking for the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad, noted the ripple effects of drought, which has doubled the cost of food and produced and led to more household debt.\\n\\nOther speakers, including the Presidents of Mauritania and Senegal, highlighted that droughts affect 1.84 billion people throughout the world, with 85% of them living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). They also emphasized:\\n\\ninterlinkages between conflicts and droughts, noting one can exacerbate the other;\\n\\nour improper use of freshwater – an intersectional issue that impacts agriculture and food production;\\n\\nIDRA as a useful tool for collective efforts to restore and sustainably manage soil;\\n\\nthe need to reinforce the capacities of youth, including young women; and\\n\\nthe need to ensure that UNCCD is given the same platforms and attention as the other Rio Conventions, and is not marginalized.\\n\\nThe event was organized by the UNCCD Secretariat and IDRA.\\n\\nAnother high-level event, convened by the Government of Botswana and supported by the UN Science-Policy-Business Forum (UN-SPBF), addressed the climate crisis and human settlements nexus in Africa. It explored integrated, cooperative multilateral approaches to tackle some of Africa’s pressing climate challenges.\\n\\nDuring the event, President of Botswana Mokgweetsi Masisi highlighted the need for smart investments promoting value addition in the transition away from fossil fuels and harnessing the continent’s potential in solar energy. He said while returns on investment are part of the solution, “reparations must be a driving principle” as well.\\n\\nOther speakers, including the President of Namibia, referred to: the operationalization of the loss and damage fund at COP 28 as a huge step forward; the need to fill the finance gap to the required USD 1.8 trillion before 2030 and for rapid disbursements to developing countries; knowledge and data to ensure targeted responses consider specific needs of each community; and efforts to promote a holistic, cross-ministerial approach to sustainable development.\\n\\nAnother event saw the launch of the Multilevel Action & Urbanization Pavilion. Co-convened by UN-Habitat and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), this event highlighted interlinkages between urbanization, climate change, and people and communities at the frontlines of climate change.\\n\\nAddressing participants former US Vice President Al Gore compared the climate movement to the “great moral-based” movements of the past, such as the civil right and women’s suffrage movements in the US.\\n\\nKatrin Jammeh, ICLEI, pointed out that, while cities account for 70% of emissions, the local level receives less than 15% of global funding.\\n\\nDuring a Multi-level Action Dialogue, speakers noted:\\n\\nthe potential of local efforts to create a domino effect leading to positive change at a global scale;\\n\\na Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, initiative to create a clean truck programme that was bolstered by state and federal funding and inspired global efforts to implement green shipping;\\n\\nBrazil’s reduction of deforestation by 40% in 2023, while increasing affordable housing, creating jobs, and developing sustainable infrastructure in Amazonian cities; and\\n\\nthe SusHi Tech Tokyo 2024 initiative in pursuit of Tokyo’s commitment to halve their carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.\\n\\nHighlighting agriculture as the primary sector impacted by loss and damage due to climate change-related events, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) organized an event looking at loss and damage in agrifood systems.\\n\\nFAO Director General QU Dongyu emphasized the need for, among others, innovations in information management to measure loss and damage and build efficiency in agrifood systems.\\n\\nDuring the event, FAO launched a report titled, ‘Loss and Damage in Agrifood Systems: Addressing Gaps and Challenges,’ which highlights the need for improved methodologies to track loss and damage, increase investment in data collection, and increase financing. The report indicates that the agriculture sector is losing, on average, USD 123 billion per year due to disaster events, but that data on climate-related loss and damage are “scant or non-existent.”\\n\\nA Youth, Indigenous Peoples, and First Nations representative pointed to the inability of Indigenous Peoples in Canada to access the loss and damage fund because they live in a developed country.\\n\\nOther speakers highlighted that: Indigenous Peoples should have a seat at the table as they are rights holders; slow-onset events, such as increasing water salinity and drought, often become more prominent as their effects reverberate across economic sectors; and data harmonization can connect “the local to the global.”', 'Reminders of the war in Gaza punctuated the speeches on Friday at the annual United Nations climate summit on a day when fighting between Israel and Hamas resumed after a weeklong cease-fire.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the “non-negotiable” price of entry to the summit for leaders from governments, business, cities and regions, civil society and finance, will be “new, credible climate action to accelerate the pace of change.”\\n\\n“No exceptions. No compromises,” he told a year-end news conference. “There will be no room for back-sliders, green-washers, blame-shifters or repackaging of announcements of previous years.”\\n\\nGuterres said the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) “is gasping for breath” and “will soon disappear” as the gap between actual greenhouse gas emissions and the amount allowing the target to be met keeps growing.\\n\\nHe said the summit will take place alongside “a crucial gathering of world leaders” during their annual September gathering at the U.N. General Assembly to discuss lagging efforts to meet the 17 U.N. goals with 169 specific targets to eradicate global poverty and hunger, achieve gender equality, improve living standards and take urgent action to combat climate change, all by 2030.\\n\\nGuterres said it will be “very similar probably” to the first Climate Action Summit that he convened in September 2019 where only those with “concrete proposals” were invited.\\n\\nAt that meeting, after an emotional appeal from then 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, leaders from 66 countries promised more ambitious climate goals to prevent a warming world from reaching even more dangerous levels and 30 swore to be carbon neutral by midcentury. But the leaders and outside experts said it wasn’t enough to stop global warming.\\n\\nGuterres blamed governments for this failure, saying “national climate plans are falling woefully short,” though he acknowledged some steps have been taken to shift the global economy away from the fossil fuel use that is largely to blame for heating up the planet.\\n\\nThe U.N. chief said he will keep pushing for what he called “a Global Solidarity Pact, in which all big emitters make an extra effort to reduce emissions this decade in line with the 1.5-degree goal and ensure support for those who need it.”\\n\\n“I have pulled no punches on the imperative for all of us to confront this existential threat,” Guterres said. “And I will not relent.”\\n\\n___\\n\\nJordans reported from Berlin.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Gauzy promises mean little without concrete plans to follow through. The Swedish activist Greta Thunberg accused the conference of consisting of a lot of “blah, blah, blah.”\\n\\nOn Saturday, diplomats from nearly 200 countries struck a major agreement aimed at intensifying efforts to fight climate change, by calling on governments to return next year with stronger plans to curb their planet-warming emissions and urging wealthy nations to “at least double” funding by 2025 to protect the most vulnerable nations from the hazards of a hotter planet.\\n\\nHere’s a look at some key takeaways from the 26th annual United Nations climate change summit.\\n\\nTime for action is running out\\n\\nThe agreement established a clear consensus that all nations need to do much more, immediately, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.\\n\\nWhen the conference opened the U.N. Secretary General, António Guterres, said the top priority must be to limit the rise in global temperatures to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold, scientists have warned, beyond which the risk of calamities like deadly heat waves, water shortages and ecosystem collapse grows immensely. (The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.)\\n\\n“The reality is you’ve got two different truths going on,” Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said last week. “We’ve made much more progress than we ever could’ve imagined a couple years ago. But it’s still nowhere near enough.”\\n\\nThe agreement outlines specific steps the world should take, from slashing global carbon dioxide emissions nearly in half by 2030 to curbing emissions of methane, another potent greenhouse gas. And it sets up new rules to hold countries accountable for the progress they make — or fail to make.\\n\\nThe environment minister of the Maldives, Shauna Aminath, said the latest text lacked the “urgency” that vulnerable countries like hers required. “What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time,” she said.\\n\\nWho needs to cut and how much?\\n\\nThe final agreement leaves unresolved the crucial question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its emissions over the next decade.\\n\\nRich countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and much of western Europe, account for just 12 percent of the global population today but are responsible for 50 percent of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years.\\n\\nPresident Biden and European leaders have insisted that countries like India, Indonesia and South Africa need to accelerate their shift away from coal power and other fossil fuels. But those countries counter that they lack the financial resources to do so, and that rich countries have been stingy with aid.\\n\\nA decade ago, the world’s wealthiest economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. But they have fallen short by tens of billions of dollars annually. The COP26 agreement still leaves many developing countries without the funds they need to build cleaner energy and cope with increasingly extreme weather disasters.\\n\\nThe call for disaster aid and regulation increases\\n\\nOne of the biggest fights at the summit in Glasgow revolved around whether — and how — the world’s wealthiest nations, which are disproportionately responsible for global warming to date, should compensate poorer nations for the damages caused by rising temperatures.\\n\\nCalls for this fund, an issue called “loss and damage,” is separate from money to help poorer countries adapt to a changing climate. Loss and damage is a matter of historic responsibility, its proponents say, and would pay for irreparable losses, such as the disappearance of national territory, culture and ecosystems.\\n\\nThe Paris agreement in 2015 urged clearer rules on how to allow polluting companies and countries to buy and trade permits to lower global emissions, but the extremely dense and technical subject continued as a topic of discussion well into Saturday in Glasgow.\\n\\nNegotiators announced a major deal on how to regulate the fast-growing global market in carbon offsets, in which one company or country compensates for its own emissions by paying someone else to reduce theirs. One of the thorniest technical issues is how to properly account for these global trades so that any reductions in emissions aren’t overestimated or double-counted.\\n\\nVulnerable countries insist that rich nations should grant them a share of proceeds from carbon market transactions to help them build resilience to climate change. The United States and the European Union have opposed doing so, but island nations in particular want a mechanism to ensure that carbon trading leads to an overall reduction in global emissions.\\n\\n“We want a credible market that will deliver reductions in emissions, not just a free pass for countries to buy cheap credits offshore to meet their national requirements,” said Ian Fry, a negotiator for the Solomon Islands, an archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nOther international agreements came out of the summit\\n\\nU.S. and China : The two countries announced a joint agreement to do more to cut emissions this decade, and China committed for the first time to develop a plan to reduce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The pact between the rivals, which are the world’s two biggest polluters, surprised delegates to the summit. The agreement was short on specifics and while China agreed to “phase down” coal starting in 2026, it did not specify by how much or over what period of time.\\n\\nDeforestation : Leaders of more than 100 countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and the United States, vowed to end deforestation by 2030. The agreement covers about 85 percent of the world’s forests, which are crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing the pace of global warming. Some advocacy groups criticized the agreement as lacking teeth, noting that similar efforts have failed in the past.\\n\\nMethane : More than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas, 30 percent by the end of this decade. The pledge was part of a push by the Biden administration, which also announced that the Environmental Protection Agency would limit the methane coming from about one million oil and gas rigs across the United States.\\n\\nIndia: India joined the growing chorus of nations pledging to reach “net zero” emissions, setting a 2070 deadline to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. One of the world’s largest consumers of coal, India also said that it would significantly expand the portion of its total energy mix that comes from renewable sources, and that half of its energy would come from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030.\\n\\nThe different faces of climate action\\n\\nThere was a clear gender and generation gap at the Glasgow talks. Those with the power to make decisions about how much the world warms in the coming decades are mostly old and male. Those who are angriest about the pace of climate action are mostly young and female.\\n\\nMalik Amin Aslam, an adviser to the prime minister of Pakistan, scoffed at some of the distant net zero goals being announced during the conference, including India’s: “With an average age of 60, I don’t think anyone in the negotiating room would live to experience that net zero in 2070,” he said.\\n\\nOn the first day of the conference, Greta Thunberg joined scores of protesters on the streets outside the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow. Throughout the two-week conference she and other young climate activists — including Vanessa Nakate, Dominika Lasota and Mitzi Tan — made numerous appearances at protests.\\n\\nMs. Thunberg told the BBC in an interview ahead of the summit that she had not been officially invited to speak. She added that she thought the organizers had not invited a lot of young speakers because they “might be scared that if they invite too many ‘radical’ young people then that might make them look bad,” she said, using air quotations.\\n\\nJust holding the talks during the pandemic posed a challenge\\n\\nThe climate summit, which was delayed last year, is one of the biggest international gatherings held during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nMany summit participants traveled from countries where vaccines are still not widely available. Globally, fewer than half of all adults have been vaccinated against Covid-19, illustrating the inequities of vaccination. Travel and quarantine restrictions meant additional costs in both time and money for lodging, which made the trip impossible for some.\\n\\nAnd some participants, like President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, decided against traveling at all.\\n\\nPartway through, conference organizers issued a letter of apology to participants for the long lines and video difficulties, saying that planning around Covid restrictions has been challenging. Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the U.N. climate body, asked attendees to “bear with us” as organizers grappled with the complex arrangements, like ensuring that all those entering the venue tested negative for the coronavirus, and enforcing controls on the number of people in meeting rooms.'], similarity=0.0)]),\n",

This is attributed to their basic units, called qubits, which can exist in any combination of states, unlike classical bits constrained to a definite value of 1 or 0. Due to this infinite variety of qubit states, a quantum computer should be able to easily handle computational problems that would take a conventional computer trillions of years to solve.\\n\\nScientists have successfully created qubits from particles such as photons, atoms, individual electrons, or even a superconducting loop. However, creating a qubit is one thing, building a working quantum computer out of thousands or even millions of qubits is an entirely different challenge, and attempts thus far have been fraught with substantial difficulties.\\n\\nFor a quantum computer to work, it is necessary to establish and manipulate subtle quantum interactions among multiple qubits — a state known as entanglement. However, for this to work, the qubits themselves need to remain stable or “coherent”, which means keeping it in a well-defined quantum state. The problem is, coherence is difficult to maintain as it easily crumbles when qubits interact with their surroundings — even radiation from space can throw them.\\n\\nTo solve this, a team of Japanese researchers led by Nobuhiro Yanai, associate professor at Kyushu University, has engineered a stable qubit using a special structure called a metal-organic framework. This structure involves combining pentacene molecules (made up of five connected benzene rings) with zirconium ions and organic dicarboxylate ligands. The pentacene molecules act like bridges, linking the ligands and ions together into a framework made up of both organic molecules and metal ions–hence the name.\\n\\nThe role of the qubit was played by a pair of neighboring pentacene molecules, which were coupled and exist within five different quantum states achieved by irradiating the metal-organic framework with various wavelengths of microwave radiation.\\n\\nThe metal-organic framework’s nanoscale voids offer the pentacene molecules a degree of freedom, but ultimately restricts their full movement under the radiation’s influence, ensuring they formed a desired quantum state and remained trapped in it for a significant amount of time.\\n\\n“The metal-organic framework in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate [pentacene molecules],” said Yanai in a press release. “Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable [them] to rotate, but at a very restrained angle.”\\n\\nThe most important result of the study was that the team could maintain coherence for more than a hundred nanoseconds at room temperature, whereas previously this could only be achieved in similar systems at incredibly cold temperatures of about -200 degrees Celsius. At such temperatures, it was possible to maintain coherence only in photonic qubits, but in addition to needing such extreme conditions to operate, quantum computers using these photon qubits suffer from photon leakage.\\n\\nMaintaining cryogenic temperatures is not only expensive but complicates the entire computing setup. Thus, creating a stable qubit that operates at room temperature is an impressive and practical achievement.\\n\\nLooking ahead, the scientists are optimistic about extending coherence for even longer periods. They believe that by designing improved metal-organic frameworks and identifying more suitable molecules for qubits, they can push the boundaries further.\\n\\n“It will be possible to generate quintet […] state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable metal-organic framework structures,” concluded Yanai. “This can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing.”\\n\\nReference: Akio Yamauchi et al, Room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework, Science Advances (2024), DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\\n\\nFeature image credit: geralt on Pixabay'], similarity=0.0), Origin(name='Bing', url=['https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-and-quantinuum-have-teamed-up-in-the-race-for-quantum-supremacy/articleshow/109103007.cms', 'https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2024/04/12/data-privacy--secure-access-to-quantum-computing-from-home-now-p.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/breakthrough-in-quantum-computing-microsoft-and-quantinuum-make-strides/ar-BB1l2Urk'], data=[\"Microsoft and Quantinuum Crack the Code (Partially)\\n\\nThe Road to Quantum Supremacy\\n\\nQuantum computing hopefuls, Microsoft and Quantinuum , have announced a significant breakthrough in creating reliable quantum computers. This advancement brings the dream of commercially viable quantum computing a step closer.The race to develop functional quantum computers is intensifying. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google (through Alphabet), and IBM are battling each other and even nation-states to harness the power of quantum mechanics.These machines promise processing speeds far exceeding traditional silicon-based computers, potentially enabling scientific breakthroughs that would take millions of years on current technology.The core building block of a quantum computer, the qubit, is both powerful and sensitive. While it offers incredible processing potential, even minor disturbances can cause data errors. To overcome this hurdle, researchers often use more physical qubits than needed and then employ error-correction techniques to create a smaller number of reliable, functional qubits.Microsoft and Quantinuum claim to have cracked the error-correction code to some extent. By applying Microsoft's error-correction algorithm to Quantinuum's physical qubits, they were able to generate four reliable qubits from a pool of 30 physical ones. According to Microsoft's Jason Zander, this represents the best ratio of functional qubits to physical qubits ever achieved.Their efforts yielded impressive results. The system successfully ran over 14,000 experiments without a single error, boasting an 800x improvement over previous records. Microsoft plans to integrate this technology into its cloud computing platform within the coming months.While the ideal number of reliable qubits needed to outperform classical supercomputers is estimated to be around 100, neither company offered a timeframe for achieving this milestone using their new technique. However, Ilyas Khan, Quantinuum's chief product officer, expressed optimism, suggesting this breakthrough could shave at least two years off the previous timeline.This development marks a significant leap towards practical quantum computing, paving the way for a future where these powerful machines can revolutionize scientific research and problem-solving across various fields.\", 'Scientists at Oxford University Physics have achieved a major breakthrough in quantum computing, ensuring unprecedented security and privacy for individuals and companies. This advancement is poised to revolutionize cloud-based quantum computing, potentially opening the doors to millions for harnessing its full power.\\n\\nQuantum computing, with its potential to transform services across various sectors such as healthcare and financial services, operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional computing, offering significantly enhanced capabilities. However, concerns regarding the stability of quantum computing in controlled conditions and the effectiveness of current security and encryption systems have been a hurdle to its widespread adoption.\\n\\nLeading providers of cloud-based services, including Google, Amazon, and IBM, have been offering quantum computing elements separately. Yet, ensuring the security and privacy of customer data has been a critical prerequisite for scaling up its use and enabling the development of new applications. The recent study by Oxford University Physics researchers addresses these critical challenges.\\n\\nProfessor David Lucas, co-head of the Oxford University Physics research team and lead scientist at the UK Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub, expressed the significance of their achievement, stating, \"We have shown for the first time that quantum computing in the cloud can be accessed in a scalable, practical way which will also give people complete security and privacy of data, plus the ability to verify its authenticity.\"\\n\\nThe researchers\\' approach, known as \"blind quantum computing,\" establishes a secure connection between two distinct quantum computing entities, potentially allowing individuals at home or in an office to access a cloud server in a completely secure manner. Importantly, their innovative methods hold the potential to be scaled up for large-scale quantum computations.\\n\\nDr. Peter Drmota, the lead researcher of the study, highlighted the implications of their work, stating, \"Using blind quantum computing, clients can access remote quantum computers to process confidential data with secret algorithms and even verify the results are correct, without revealing any useful information. Realizing this concept is a big step forward in both quantum computing and keeping our information safe online.\"\\n\\nThe system devised by the researchers involves a fiber network link between a quantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, enabling blind quantum computing over a network. The researchers utilized a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this, ensuring real-time compliance with the algorithm for every computation.\\n\\nProfessor David Lucas emphasized the urgency of addressing privacy and security concerns in the era of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, stating, \"As quantum computers become more capable, people will seek to use them with complete security and privacy over networks, and our new results mark a step change in capability in this respect.\"', ''], similarity=0.0)]),\n",

When I first started writing about the public’s hostility toward expertise and established knowledge more than a decade ago, I predicted that any number of crises—including a pandemic—might be the moment that snaps the public back to its senses. I was wrong. I didn’t foresee how some citizens and their leaders would respond to the cycle of advances and setbacks in the scientific process and to the inevitable limitations of human experts.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic, in particular, would prove the perfect crucible for accelerating the decline of faith in experts. Paranoia and appeals to ignorance have long been part of the American political environment, but they were especially destructive at a time when the U.S. was riven by partisan hostility. The pandemic struck at multiple political and cultural weaknesses within the edifice of American life: A mysterious disease—from China, no less, a nation that typically serves as a source of American anxiety—forced citizens to rely on the media, including outlets that many of them already distrusted, for scattered pieces of information from white-jacketed experts and relatively unknown government officials.\\n\\nMany elected leaders, especially at the national level, failed, in fact, to lead. The dysfunction of President Donald Trump’s administration, on COVID-19 and on so many other issues, has been amply documented in numerous books and articles. Despite the undeniable success of Operation Warp Speed, the government’s crash program to work with private industry to develop a vaccine in record time, Trump and his people have much to answer for—including the hesitancy they engendered among Americans to take the very vaccines that his administration helped develop.\\n\\nThe road to America’s pandemic meltdown, however, did not begin with Trump. When the coronavirus arrived, a significant number of Americans were already primed by the media, their political leaders, and their own stubborn narcissism to reject expert advice during a crisis. The collapse of gatekeeping authority in the media, the explosion of worthless online sources, the emergence of celebrity pseudo-experts, and the unwarranted self-confidence of millions of people who believed that they could simply “do their own research,” as the internet mantra has it, all combined to make a brutal outbreak of disease even more deadly.\\n\\nRead: The coronavirus-denial movement now has a leader\\n\\nNevertheless, where the death of expertise is concerned, the scientific community and its allies in the public-policy arena made two fundamental mistakes early on. One is that they tried to take the place of elected officials: They issued guidance and policy instructions while trying to fill the vacuum left by poor leadership in Washington, D.C., and other regions of the United States. And at the height of the lockdowns, doctors and local authorities in some cities made a nakedly political calculation about whether and when their ostensibly firm pandemic restrictions could be ignored.\\n\\nMasks and lockdowns were among the most divisive pandemic measures. As usual, Trump was resolutely ignorant and self-centered. He and his movement coalesced around depicting such public-health measures as symbols of government autocracy. At a July 2020 White House meeting, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, advised him to advocate for mask mandates, which at that point even most Republicans supported. Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, objected. “We can’t do the masks,” he told the president. “The base will just turn on you.” Trump sided with Meadows.\\n\\nBut many of Trump’s opponents themselves adopted a blinkered insistence on such mandates as their own version of political signaling. In an already polarized environment, each side hoisted their flags and charged into battle—with scant regard for evidence or expert advice.\\n\\nThe scientists unwisely stepped into this mess, with predictable results. The American public has little tolerance for nuance or complexity, and the recommendations on mask wearing were difficult to parse and changed over time. What kind of mask would work best? (An N-95 respirator—if worn correctly.) Would cloth masks work? Bandannas, maybe? (Probably not very well.) Should masks be worn everywhere? Indoors, outdoors—even at home?\\n\\nThe public wanted clear and unambiguous answers that the scientists could not give them: yes or no, safe or unsafe, on or off. Woefully unaccustomed to explaining complicated issues to ordinary citizens, they made a hash of the messaging and simply tried to push for masks as a generic measure, until many Americans—even those who wanted to be cooperative—gave up.\\n\\nAdvocates for lockdowns and strict masking rules argued that they had the stronger point in a time of uncertainty. Such prophylactic measures, they contended, even if ragged and inconsistent, were better than flatly ignoring manifest public-health dangers. But “following the science” means following all of the science, and these rigid, dogmatic responses downplayed the fact that the science was also showing that some COVID-19 policies did, in fact, carry a destructive price. The lockdowns, as the COVID Crisis Group (a nonpartisan collection of scholars and scientists) noted later, were not a solution but a “sledgehammer” that took the place of better preparation and resulted from an inability to agree on almost anything else.\\n\\nThe subsequent extended closure of public spaces in the U.S. produced deep social and economic wounds, but the controversy over when to reopen schools was a particularly important area of expert failure. The closures of educational institutions went on too long in many parts of the country, resulting in emotional and intellectual damage to American students.\\n\\nRead: Paging Dr. Hamblin: Why didn’t America’s shutdowns work?\\n\\nMany progressives, however, bitterly contested growing evidence both that in-person schooling was relatively safe and that school closures had created catastrophic learning loss. This was in many cases a stubborn reaction, a kind of polar opposition to the obdurate people on the right who dismissed almost all pandemic measures as oppression. For the left, as the New York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait later noted, “the evidence did eventually win out,” while the Republicans descended into an “epistemic disaster” that persists to this day.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the evidence did not win out in time to prevent harm, especially in schools. Public-school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom, but many teachers were hesitant, and one of their largest unions, the American Federation of Teachers, and its leader, Randi Weingarten, were resistant to the point of militancy. Weingarten warned in July 2020 that the AFT might even support strikes if teachers were forced back to the classroom.\\n\\nThe pressure from the AFT had a clear effect on national policy subsequently. Within weeks of taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden backpedaled on his campaign promises to open schools. According to my Atlantic colleague Franklin Foer, Biden acquiesced to writing off the rest of the academic year as “the price of peace” with the union.\\n\\nThe teachers’ concerns were understandable, but the intransigence of some of their union leaders did significant harm to their already battered standing. Meanwhile, over those same months, another expert community—this time, medical professionals—needlessly inflicted a grievous wound on the impartiality of their own expertise.\\n\\nOn May 25, 2020, a white police officer murdered a Black man named George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis. The incident was captured on video and protests soon broke out all over America.\\n\\nDoctors and scientists had a problem on their hands. Floyd’s killing produced an outpouring of grief and anger: Americans wanted to gather, they wanted to support one another, they wanted to vent their fury, and they wanted to shout their demands for justice into the face of their government. And yet because of COVID-19 restrictions, most Americans could not congregate in public. They could not go to church or sing in a choir. They could not celebrate their marriages, bury their dead, or even, in some areas, meet outdoors for a picnic. Schoolchildren were still trapped in their homes.\\n\\nAmerica’s cities were beginning to boil, and public-safety officials faced a no-win situation: If states and localities tried to suppress the demonstrations, their directions would be ignored. But if they allowed the protests, they were admitting that the pandemic restrictions were capricious rules that could bend in the political wind. How could one cause be important enough to allow thousands upon thousands of people to gather in close proximity, while all other citizens were told that their rights—including their freedom to worship and to engage in peaceful assembly—were secondary to the needs of public health and that they must stay home?\\n\\nRead: Facing a COVID-19 resurgence and unable to act\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci was at the time the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the U.S. government’s main public-health spokespeople. He would later enter right-wing demonology caricatured as a leftist authoritarian, but in June 2020 he gave one of the most diplomatic and sensible answers to be found among the scientists:\\n\\nIt’s a difficult situation. We have the right to peacefully demonstrate and the demonstrators are exercising that right … It’s a delicate balance because the reasons for demonstrating are valid and yet the demonstration itself puts oneself at an additional risk. The only thing we can do as public-health officials is to keep warning people to be careful. And if you are going to go out, please make sure you wear a mask and you keep the mask on at all times.\\n\\nOther doctors, however, were eager to show solidarity with the protests. In June 2020, more than 1,200 medical professionals signed an open letter supporting the demonstrations, casting Floyd’s death as a health menace on the same level as the pandemic. “Infectious disease and public health narratives adjacent to demonstrations against racism must be consciously anti-racist, and infectious disease experts must be clear and consistent in prioritizing an anti-racist message,” they wrote. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.”\\n\\nNoble if stilted rhetoric, but even people who empathized with the protesters had to notice that the previous strict prohibitions on gathering were now, for the sake of an important political cause, apparently negotiable. According to The Washington Post, Ranu S. Dhillon, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard Medical School, characterized the protests as risky but necessary—just like working in a nursing home or grocery store, an approach that showed how out of touch many professionals were with ordinary people who were afraid to visit elderly relatives or go to the market.\\n\\nThe available evidence does not so far suggest that the protests created a major surge in COVID-19 infections. But to argue that the sudden reversal in public-health advice did not result in more infections is a post hoc rationalization—and, for experts, a trap.\\n\\nAt the time, the medical guidance was clear that people should not gather in large groups or be in proximity, and certainly not while singing and shouting. If doctors believed that the risks of such gatherings could be mitigated with masks or by being outdoors, they should have already been pressing for the lifting of the strictest measures everywhere, with the same advice they gave protesters. But if they were still holding to the theories that underpinned the lockdowns—and especially the school closures—then their approval of the demonstrations meant they were consciously setting aside those concerns in the name of a political cause with which they agreed.\\n\\nEither way, they were acting as advocates rather than scientists. In the words of the environmental journalist Peter M. Sandman, they “clearly damaged the credibility of public health as a scientific enterprise that struggles to be politically neutral.”\\n\\nThe global pandemic emergency is formally over, and the experts are still assessing what they did right and wrong—as they should. But in the U.S., the political damage from the coronavirus wars remains. The most intrusive measures, including lockdowns and masking, are long gone. For most Americans, especially the elderly and other vulnerable groups, avoiding the most serious consequences of COVID-19 has become chiefly a matter of getting vaccinated and staying current on booster shots, as they would with flu and pneumonia.\\n\\nAnd yet, the U.S. still lags the rest of the developed world in protection against COVID-19. According to the CDC’s most up-to-date data, from 2023, some 70 percent of Americans received an initial vaccination, but fewer than 20 percent have had any booster. The rates are much better among people over 65, who—for various reasons, including their awareness of the disease’s increased danger for their age group—are more attentive to getting vaccinated.\\n\\nThe ultimate numbers, however, obscure the deep political divisions over vaccination, preventive measures, and science itself. A New York Times/Siena poll in 2023 found that nearly 70 percent of likely Republican voters would trust “the common sense of ordinary people” over “the knowledge of trained experts.” (In a Pew poll a year earlier, 51 percent of Americans said that public-health officials had done an excellent or good job at managing the pandemic, but that number was anchored by the 72 percent of Democrats who felt that way; only 29 percent of Republicans agreed.)\\n\\nTrump, of course, has continued his crude deployment of ignorance and fear in his second bid to regain the American presidency. When new variants of the virus began to spread in the summer of 2023, Trump released a video decrying the “tyrants” who were going to impose new pandemic mandates. “We will not comply,” he said, defying measures that did not actually exist. Fortunately, most people in the United States now have some level of immunity, and governments at all levels have learned a great deal about monitoring and treating the disease.\\n\\nNonetheless, as the COVID Crisis Group noted in 2023, “one key predictor of infections and total COVID deaths” in each state during the pandemic “was the share of people that voted for President Trump in the 2020 presidential election.” Or, as a member of the group remarked in an overview of the pandemic’s course and the American lives lost, “Trump was a comorbidity.”\\n\\nJay Varma: The public-health calculus has shifted\\n\\nThe experts failed at some important points, especially in the early days of the pandemic, but much of what the public believed to be failure was better described as science—the way that knowledge itself is developed as experts worked through a new problem with limited data. They argued and tested competing explanations and solutions. Such debates and discussions, along with the inevitable costs of trial and error during a time of emergency, are the normal processes of scientific investigation. But America’s political environment in 2020, poisoned by ignorance and rigid tribalism, virtually guaranteed that almost all aspects of the pandemic response—both failures and successes—would become divisive and partisan issues.\\n\\nExperts are fallible human beings, and they will sometimes give poor advice or make mistakes. But an advanced society and its government cannot do without them, no matter what a significant number of Americans seem to believe. To ignore expert advice is simply not a realistic option: Policy making is complex, and citizens have some responsibility to stay informed about issues that directly affect their own well-being. Experts always need to remember that they are the servants, not the masters, of a democratic society and a republican government. But as James Madison presciently warned, if citizens are to be the authors of their own fate, they must first equip themselves with knowledge, and then practice the civic virtue based on reason and cooperation that makes an informed democracy possible.\\n\\nBefore the next crisis—and there will always be another—citizens, experts, and policy makers have to engage in a difficult debate about the role of experts and educated elites in American democracy. For now, such possibilities have been thwarted by the partisan combat that erupted after the coronavirus pandemic. I still have confidence that we can, at some point, embrace the reality-based understandings we once accepted as obvious: Chief among them is that although every single vote in a democracy is as equally valid as every other, every single opinion is not.\\n\\nAmerica needs to reestablish new rules for productive engagement between the educated elites and the society they serve. But after the political events and natural disasters of the past decade, the creation of a more productive relationship between the experts and the public is going to be a challenge, and it will require time. The sooner the better, because the clock, as always, is counting down to the next unknown disaster.\\n\\nThis essay is adapted from a new edition of the author’s book The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters .', 'Plastic pollution may have met its match: The saliva of wax worms NBC\\n\\nThiel, Bezos and Zuckerberg join parade of insiders selling tech stocks FT\\n\\nClimate\\n\\n#COVID19\\n\\nThousands of disabled people died after ‘Covid treatment withheld’, inquiry to probe iNews.

Unfortunately, this change was not well recognized by the public and as many as 58% answered they were not aware of the relaxed policy in a November 2022 survey . The television news, and newspapers at that time [i.e., official propaganda] were welcoming life without masks again, especially when the notoriously hot and humid summer season in Japan was approaching. The subsequent 7th surge, however, was the most severe surge since the pandemic was declared and Japan had the world’s worst record for 10 consecutive weeks during July and September 2022 according to the WHO report [11]. This surge frightened people [My goodness me, why?] and they voluntarily continued to practice masking, though the government mask-wearing policy was left relaxed during the 7th surge.\\n\\nAnd letting the cat out of the bag:\\n\\nOther than the 7th surge, extreme mask affinity which could be referred [indeed it could, but by whom?} to as “mask dependence” developed after 3 years of daily masking practice is also a contributing factor.\\n\\n“Seatbelt dependence,” “water treatment dependence”, “manual safety dependence,” “traffic light dependence”….\\n\\nAwaiting a decision on new research regulations, scientists pen dueling articles to shape ‘gain-of-function’ policies Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

Policymakers Seem Afraid to Say So. It started by saying:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt. Unfortunately, many elected leaders and public health officials have held on far too long to the hypothesis that natural immunity offers unreliable protection against covid-19 — a contention that is being rapidly debunked by science.\\n\\nThese three sentences have an interesting relationship, don’t they?\\n\\nWe’ll Have Herd Immunity by April\\n\\nI’ll return to them in a bit, but first let’s flashback to February 2021. 450,000 Americans died of COVID in in the pandemic’s first year, overwhelming hospitals and morgues. The worst wave, where over 3,000 Americans died per day, was just receding. The virus was just 1 year-old, and it had given us plenty of reasons to respect it so far.\\n\\nNot everyone felt that way.\\n\\nOn February 18th, Dr. Markary authored an article titled We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April. He was very confident about this new virus. “Experts should level with the public about the good news,” he said. He said:\\n\\nSome medical experts privately agreed with my prediction that there may be very little Covid-19 by April but suggested that I not to talk publicly about herd immunity because people might become complacent and fail to take precautions or might decline the vaccine. But scientists shouldn’t try to manipulate the public by hiding the truth…Herd immunity is the inevitable result of viral spread and vaccination. When the chain of virus transmission has been broken in multiple places, it’s harder for it to spread—and that includes the new strains.\\n\\nThen in March, he authored an article titled Herd Immunity Is Near, Despite Fauci’s Denial. He said:\\n\\nAnthony Fauci has been saying that the country needs to vaccinate 70% to 85% of the population to reach herd immunity from Covid-19. But he inexplicably ignores natural immunity. If you account for previous infections, herd immunity is likely close at hand.\\n\\nIn May, Dr. Makary continued his media blitz to announce big news. He had been right. Herd immunity had arrived, and it was time to “stop living in fear”. In an article titled Don’t Buy The Fearmongering: The COVID-19 Threat Is Waning he said “On a clinical level, we simply have not seen significant re-infections at any concerning rate.” “The public-health threat is now defanged”, he added.\\n\\nIn another article titled Risk Of COVID Is Now Very Low — It’s Time To Stop Living In Fear: Doctor he said:\\n\\nCOVID cases are collapsing in front of our eyes…Yet some people want the pandemic to stretch out longer\\n\\nDuring an interview on Fox New that month, he dismissed the concerns about variants and said the main priority was to not “scare people”. “People need something to look forward to,” he said. He also had this exchange:\\n\\nQuestion: You talked about this a couple of months ago. You said look, we are two months away from herd immunity. Are we there, are we closer, is it ever going to be full realized in your estimation? Answer: Well unfortunately, we have this perception now that’s being created by some public health leaders that we reach to total eradication. And we’re not going to get to total risk elimination. That is a false goal and quite honestly it’s being used to manipulate the public. We heard today if get to 70% vaccination, then we can see restrictions. That’s dishonest. Most of the country is at herd immunity. Other parts will get there later this month… I call that herd immunity.\\n\\nI don’t remember anyone serious talking about “total risk elimination” in May 2021, though through this straw man argument, Dr. Makary sought to convince his audience that “public health leaders” were dishonest manipulators out to scare people. In contrast, he was a straight shooter, willing to tell bravely the truth- most of the country is at herd immunity.\\n\\nIn June, Dr. Makary formalized his thoughts in an article called The Power of Natural Immunity, another article that paid homage to the “power” of being infected with a potentially deadly virus. He said:\\n\\nThe news about the U.S. Covid pandemic is even better than you’ve heard… There’s ample scientific evidence that natural immunity is effective and durable, and public-health leaders should pay it heed.\\n\\nHe added:\\n\\nWith more than 8 in 10 adults protected from either contracting or transmitting the virus, it can’t readily propagate by jumping around in the population. In public health, we call that herd immunity, defined broadly on the Johns Hopkins Covid information webpage as “when most of a population is immune.” It’s not eradication, but it’s powerful.\\n\\nDr. Makary concluded:\\n\\nIt’s time to stop the fear mongering and level with the public.\\n\\nSo far this year, nearly 2.8 million cases of COVID have been reported in the U.S.\\n\\nLet’s return to those three sentences from Dr. Makary’s article Natural Immunity to Covid Is Powerful. Policymakers Seem Afraid to Say So:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt. Unfortunately, many elected leaders and public health officials have held on far too long to the hypothesis that natural immunity offers unreliable protection against covid-19 — a contention that is being rapidly debunked by science.\\n\\nWe all know what happened next.\\n\\nSince February 2021, when Dr. Makary penned We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April, around 700,000 Americans have died of COVID and millions more have been injured by it. It’s not over yet. Unfortunately, those “elected leaders and public health officials” turned out to be right. Natural immunity offers unreliable protection against COVID, and reinfections are hardly rare events. Despite the abundance and “power” of natural immunity, we still do not have herd immunity.\\n\\nDelta is downgraded to a mild seasonal virus that causes mild common cold-like symptoms.\\n\\nSo, did Dr. Makary adapt when new data proved his scientific hypothesis was incorrect? Not that I’ve seen. I have not seen him acknowledge his bizarre fetishization of the “power of natural immunity” was misplaced. I have not seen him revisit his doomed declarations of herd immunity. I have not seen him retract his unprofessional slurs that “public health leaders” were “dishonest” and trying to “manipulate the public” because they wanted the pandemic to continue.\\n\\nHe’s not alone.\\n\\nMany doctors sounded exactly like Dr. Makary in 2021. These “free-thinking” doctors also claimed that natural immunity was a “triumph,” that vaccines were a panacea for those who needed them, that variants were nothing to “panic” about, and that kid’s didn’t need the COVID vaccine because the pandemic was ending. They too disparaged anyone who disagreed as having an “addiction to doom and gloom.”\\n\\nYet, when the pandemic failed to end, these doctors just barreled on full-steam ahead as if none of that ever happened. Their confident, optimistic proclamations- most of the country is at herd immunity– were made and then instantly forgotten, without a moment’s recognition of error or the slightest expression of regret to those they smeared as “fear mongers.”\\n\\nIn fact, doctors who said the pandemic was winding down in the first half of 2021, devoted the second half of that year not to pausing their COVID commentary and reflecting on their failed forecasts, but rather by doubling down and minimizing the variants that obliterated their pollyannaish predictions. No matter what was happening on the ground, they just kept robotically repeating the exact same things they’d always said. There was always “reassuring data“. It was always time to stop “living in fear“. They were all completely predictable.\\n\\nArticles from February, July, and December 2021\\n\\nLike these doctors, Dr. Makary also failed to adapt to new data when the Delta variant arrived, wrecking his declarations of herd immunity. As it ripped through much the country, he just kept robotically repeating the exact same things he’d always said. He gave in interview in June titled Dr. Marty Makary Pans ‘Fear-Mongering’ Over Delta Variant, and in August he said:\\n\\nIf you’re one of the 99%+ of kids that are unvaccinated…those kids don’t need to worry…For most people right now, Delta is downgraded to a mild seasonal virus that causes mild common cold-like symptoms…The vaccines have been perfectly consistent against all of the variants.\\n\\nOf course, Dr. Makary and these other doctors were wrong about the Delta variant, which caused “record deaths” in many parts of the country and hit children harder than ever before, especially unvaccinated ones.\\n\\nPredictably, Dr. Makary also failed to adapt to new data when the Omicron variant arrived. As it ripped through much the country, he just kept robotically repeating the exact same things he’d always said. In December, he glorified the Omicron variant as “nature’s vaccine” and in an interview on Fox News titled Omicron Fear Fueling a ‘Second Pandemic of Lunacy’ said:\\n\\nWe’re seeing this massive new wave of fear that is fueling our second pandemic after COVID-19, which is a pandemic of lunacy, which is omicron. Now I call it omi-cold… This new scientific data from the lab explains the epidemiological data and the bedside observation of doctors that this is far more mild… and that’s why I call it omi-cold.\\n\\nOf course, Dr. Makary and these other doctors were wrong about the Omicron variant, as the articles During the Omicron Wave, Death Rates Soared for Older People and Hospitalizations Of Young Children With The Virus Surged During The U.S. Omicron Wave explain.\\n\\nAll that from the doctor who instructed others:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt.\\n\\nPublic health officials actively propagated misinformation that ruined lives and forever damaged public trust in the medical profession.\\n\\nMany people adapted to new data and relinquished their optimistic pandemic estimations when immune-evading variants arrived in the summer of 2021. These doctors did not. Minimizing COVID was a pure reflex for them. It was literally all they could do. What more could the virus have done to make them say, “OOPS! I was wrong to have said the pandemic was over“? The answer, of course, is “nothing.”\\n\\nTo my knowledge, just one of these doctors has ever acknowledged error for prematurely declaring the pandemic over. He’s also stopped doing this. Good for him. However, I can’t recall any doctor who said the pandemic ended in spring 2021 who later had the integrity to honestly reckon with the consequences of blasting out that false message in major media outlets for months on end. Million of Americans trusted these highly-credential doctors who spoke with great confidence when they said what we all wanted to hear.\\n\\nHow are these people doing today? Did all they all turn out OK?\\n\\nPredictably, instead of showing even a hint of concern about the fate of their audience and introspecting for a nanosecond, these doctors keep robotically repeating the exact same things they’ve always said. Despite his inglorious track record, Dr. Makary still fancies himself a brave truth-teller, entitled to sanctimoniously scold those dastardly “public health officials”. In an article from February 2023, ironically titled 10 Myths Told by COVID Experts — And Now Debunked, Dr. Makary spread blatant anti-vaccine falsities and continued to lavish praise on “natural immunity”. He also said this:\\n\\nPublic health officials actively propagated misinformation that ruined lives and forever damaged public trust in the medical profession.\\n\\nImagine the utter audacity, shamelessness, and lack of self-awareness it takes for the author of We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April to write that contemptible slur about people who were right about herd immunity 3-years ago. Nonetheless, I won’t disagree with him for saying:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt.\\n\\nThat’s actually a really good idea.\\n\\nArticles from February, May, June, and December 2021\\n\\nShares'], similarity=0.0), Origin(name='Google', url=['https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-need-to-panic-over-covid-surge-but-mask-up-say-doctors/articleshow/106193814.cms', 'https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/responding-to-the-new-covid-19-sub-variants-now-and-in-future/article67696277.ece', 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/covid-is-on-the-rise-as-who-alerts-virus-still-changing-evolving-as-jn-1-subvariant-cases-surges-11702865050415.html'], data=['Should everyone with symptoms be tested?\\n\\nIf testing is low, how can a surge be prevented?\\n\\nShould we wear a mask?\\n\\nIs it time for boosters yet?\\n\\nPrecautions to be taken by the government\\n\\nNearly 7 months after the WHO withdrew the public health emergency notification for Covid-19, the virus refuses to go away. The Omicron variant has mutated into several new subvariants, with the latest, JN.1, causing a surge in Covid cases. While experts said they will wait for a few more days before calling it a new wave and there’s no need to panic, they warn that the WHO-declared “variant of interest” may not be the last on the list.Seasonal flu like influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), respiratory infections caused by adenovirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus can cause monsoon-related ailments that mimic Covid-19 symptoms, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, former WHO chief scientist, said.“It is not possible to test everyone with symptoms. We must test people hospitalized with severe respiratory infection or pneumonia,” she said.One way to predict a surge is to look for microbes in wastewater. In several countries, wastewater sample are tested to detect and report on different infections circulating in a community, Dr Subramanian Swaminathan, an infectious diseases expert at Gleneagles Global Health City, said.“Wearing a mask in closed crowded spaces like wedding halls, trains and buses is a good idea. It can prevent several air-borne illnesses including Covid,” Dr K Kolandaisamy, former director of public health, says.“But there is no need to make masks mandatory yet. Elderly, pregnant women, and people with immune deficiencies must avoid going into crowded spaces. If they do, they must wear a mask. Those with respiratory infections, colds, and cough should also wear masks in crowded spaces,” he says.Vaccines have been working well in preventing severe disease. However, waning immunity is visible. People infected earlier and those vaccinated with at least 2 doses still get infected.JN.1 has been called a “variant of interest” by the WHO because of its transmissibility. In several countries, including India, updated versions of the vaccine are already available.“The elderly, people with comorbidities and chronic medical conditions are strongly recommended to take the vaccine,” Dr S Ramasubramanian, an infectious diseases expert at Apollo Hospitals, said.The directorate of public health advised all hospitals to keep equipment ready. Hospitals have been asked to do mock drills after checking on stock of medicines, and oxygen storage, Dr TS Selvavinayagam, director of public health, said.', 'January 02, 2024 12:59 am | Updated 12:31 pm IST\\n\\nIt is four years since the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later renamed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV2) was first reported on December 31, 2019 from China. In the months which followed, it caused severe COVID-19 waves in nearly every country, across the world. Alongside, at end December or early new year, there would be news of a new variant or sub-variant, or of a surge in cases in some countries. At the end of 2021, it was an Omicron variant (BA.1.1.529), and by the end 2022, the COVID-19 case surge in China made news. Now, a new subvariant of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the JN.1, is making news.\\n\\nVirus behaviour\\n\\nThe JN.1 sub-variant of Omicron has been reported from multiple countries and designated as a variant of interest (VoI) by the World Health Organization. This has raised some concerns and caused some worries. But is it really cause for concern? The short answer is a no. The reason is that the reporting of a new variant or sub-variant is on expected lines. In fact, in May 2023, while declaring the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO had highlighted the need for continuous tracking of the virus and its variants. The rationale was simple. The pandemic is over, but SARS-CoV-2 was and is circulating in all countries and all settings and will continue to do so for long, and possibly forever. That is how most viruses behave. Therefore, there is always the possibility of some seasonal changes in the number of cases, at unpredictable intervals. A linked feature is that the genetic material of the circulating viruses — especially of the respiratory virus — keeps changing over a period. These changes in genetic structure (genome) result in the designation of new variants and sub-variants.\\n\\nSince the reporting of the novel virus in 2019, more than 1,000 subvariants and recombinant sub-lineages have been reported. Against this backdrop, the emergence of JN.1 is not surprising. However, every change in genome does not matter, and the international agencies and subject experts are on task to assess the risk. However, if mutations or genetic changes result in an alternation in the characteristics of the virus (such as higher transmission, more severe disease or immune escape from vaccine induced or natural immunity), it merits greater attention. The variants are then termed as VoI or variants of concern (VoC). At present, there is no VoC in circulation in any part of the world. On March 16, 2023, WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution had downgraded the Omicron as the ‘previous’ variants of concern. However, national and global agencies are tracking the virus and JN.1 has been designated as VoI.\\n\\nJN.1 has been designated a VoI, which means it has some genetic changes and indicative characteristics in circulating viruses which need to be monitored by the health agencies and government. Such a designation is a call to step up genomic sequencing scientific work and use data to track the virus. JN.1 is not a new virus but a sub-variant of BA.2.86, which itself is a subvariant of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Till now, there is no evidence that JN.1 causes more severe disease or causes immune escape and is, thus, not a reason for worry. In short, designating a variant as VoI does not automatically mean there is a reason to worry. Till now, there is no evidence that JN.1 is responsible for severe disease or immune escape. In fact, the waste-water surveillance in some Indian cities had indicated that the new sub-variant has circulated to a majority of the population without major change in reported or clinical cases in the way of a ‘silent wave’.\\n\\nThe vaccine response\\n\\nDoes it mean we need to get additional shots of COVID-19 vaccines? Current scientific evidence supports that vaccines and natural infection continue to provide protection from any sub-variant, though there is some possibility of a decline in protection, as time has lapsed since the last vaccination. Immunologically, the natural infections which have happened in addition to vaccine shots, have provided hybrid immunity to people in India and many countries. Therefore, there is no immediate reason to worry. There is no scientific evidence to support having a fourth shot of COVID-19 vaccines, for any age group.\\n\\nWe also need to interpret the rise in COVID-19 cases more carefully. The spike in COVID-19 cases in India could be more artificial than real. It is likely that ramped up COVID-19 testing is picking more cases. Then, some deaths are being attributed to COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that those deaths are causally linked to SARS-CoV-2. These appear to be in the individuals who were already sick and had COVID-19, as an incidental finding. The average five or six deaths in a day in India also need to be considered in perspective.\\n\\nTo put this in context, every day in India, an estimated 27,000 people die due to a range of reasons that include old age. In contrast, respiratory diseases and tuberculosis kill 50 to 60 times more people every day than COVID-19 now. We need to shift attention to preventable deaths due to many other reasons.\\n\\nAct responsibly\\n\\nYet, four years should help us to learn. The government’s COVID-19 response and actions should be more nuanced and informed by all evidence and real time data. Citizens need to act responsibly and not share unverified social media messages or forwards. Science communication from the government needs to be more interactive, and public communication messaging should be more routine and easy to understand. There is a possibility scenario where reported COVID-19 cases may increase slightly in the days ahead, or in the months ahead — as it happened in April 2023 when daily cases had spiked. However, for most circulating respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, mere transmission or an increase in cases is not an immediate concern. Right now, SARS-CoV-2 infections do not appear to change clinical outcomes in any age groups.\\n\\nHow should we respond to current or any future uptick due to SARS-CoV-2? The short answer is in the same way that we respond to any seasonal rise in cases of flu, respiratory illnesses or dengue virus. By the government increasing standard public health preventive measures such as Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza-like Illness (ILI) surveillance, waste water surveillance and improving provision of required services at health facilities. The clinical management should focus on a syndromic approach to respiratory illnesses. At the individual and community levels, there is no need to disturb the routine or change your travel or vacation plans. People with cough and cold or flu-like illness must follow good respiratory etiquette such as wearing masks in public places, covering their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and frequent handwashing, irrespective of whether it is a type of SARS-CoV-2, seasonal flu or any other respiratory illness. It is proven that the risk to children is the lowest among any age group and thus, school closure should never be considered an option in response to a COVID-19 case surge.\\n\\nIt is time we handle SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 just like any other respiratory illness. It is more of an individual health concern than a public health concern. COVID-19 is not a novel virus any more and is here to stay. But it is not a reason to worry.\\n\\nDr. Chandrakant Lahariya is a medical doctor with over 15 years of work experience with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the India Country office, the regional office for Africa, Brazzaville; and the WHO headquarters in Geneva. The views expressed are personal', 'In the wake of the surge in respiratory diseases and new JN.1 COVID sub-variant, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that the virus is evolving and changing and urged the member states to continue with strong surveillance and sequence sharing.\\n\\nThe global body also shared a video of its COVID-19 technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, who explained the reason for the recent surges and what precautions can be taken.\\n\\n\"Dr @mvankerkhove talks about the current surge in respiratory diseases #COVID19 and JN.1 subvariant. WHO continues to assess the situation. Follow WHO\\'s public health advice to keep your families and friends safe during this holiday season,\" WHO posted on X (formerly Twitter).\\n\\nMaria Van Kerkhove also took to the social media platform and said that a number of pathogens have led to the rise in respiratory diseases across the world.\\n\\n\"Respiratory diseases are increasing around the world due to a number of pathogens incl #COVID19, #flu, rhinovirus, mycoplasma pneumonia & othersSARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. JN.1 (subvariant of BA.2.86) is already a VOI and continues to increase in circulation,\" she stated.\\n\\nIn the video message, Kerkhove said that the recent surge in respiratory infections is due to multiple reasons, including increased gatherings during the holiday season and other infections.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not just COVID-19 that\\'s circulating; we have influenza, other viruses, and bacteria. In other parts of the world, we are entering the winter months, and people are starting to gather for the holiday season. And as people gather, they spend more time indoors, especially if there is poor ventilation. These pathogens that spread efficiently between people and through the air will take advantage,\" she said.\\n\\nShe further explained that the rise in COVID cases is because the virus is evolving, adding that 68 per cent of the current cases are cases of XBB sublineages and other groupings like JN.1.\\n\\n\"Covid-19 is one of the diseases that is currently on the rise, and this is again due to a number of factors; the virus SARS-Cov-2 is evolving, changing, and circulating in all countries,\" Kerkhove said.\\n\\nShe added, \"In some countries, we have these XBB sublineages, and they represent around 68 per cent or so of the sequences that are shared globally. The other grouping is BA.2.86, most notably JN.1 which causes the full spectrum, everything from asymptomatic infection. All the way to severe disease and death, similar to what we have seen with other Omicron sublineages.\"\\n\\nThe WHO expert urged the member states to continue with strong surveillance and sequence sharing so that proper steps can be taken to \"potentially modify\" the advice for the world.\\n\\nShe also advised people to get vaccinations and, in cases of infection, take clinical care.\\n\\n\"Protect yourself from infection using a number of tools. But also make sure that if you get infected, you get clinical care and get vaccinated when it\\'s your turn to prevent severe disease and death. All COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide against severe disease and death, and this includes all the circulating variants, including JN.1,\" Kerkhove said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Union Ministry of Health has initiated preparedness measures after a case of the JN.1 subvariant of COVID was found in Kerala as part of the ongoing routine surveillance conducted by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).\\n\\nA mock drill is underway in health facilities across states, evaluating public health and hospital readiness. This exercise, overseen by district collectors, commenced on December 13 and is scheduled for completion by December 18, 2023.\\n\\nWhile the majority of cases in Kerala are reported to be clinically mild, the health authorities emphasise the importance of ongoing vigilance and preparedness to effectively manage the evolving situation related to COVID-19 variants.\\n\\nThe India SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a network of Genomic Laboratories, has been actively monitoring the genomic aspects of COVID-19 in India.\\n\\nThe reported symptoms include fever, runny nose, sore throat, headache, and, in some cases, mild gastrointestinal symptoms.

While the original Omicron strain (BA.1) is no longer circulating, Omicron subvariants are now driving most of the country’s SARS-CoV-2 infections. Omicron was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November 2021, and cases quickly began to surface and multiply in other countries. By December of that year, Omicron was causing daily case numbers in the U.S. to skyrocket to over a million. In 2022, it had spawned a number of subvariants. In 2023, a new Omicron strain called EG.5 (nicknamed “Eris”) is the dominant strain in the U.S., and experts are monitoring another new strain called BA.2.86 (nicknamed “Pirola”).\\n\\nHow contagious is it? Omicron’s subvariants are considered to be especially efficient spreaders of the disease. The original strain of Omicron was more transmissible than Delta was. One explanation was that more than 30 of Omicron’s mutations are on the virus’s spike protein, the part that attaches to human cells, and several of those are believed to increase the probability of infection.\\n\\nSeverity: Scientists are still working to learn more about whether the current Omicron strains cause more severe disease than their predecessors. Data has suggested that the original Omicron strain was less severe, in general, than previous variants, according to the CDC. But it has also been noted that surges in cases may lead to significant increases in hospitalizations and deaths, as they did during the variant’s spread at the beginning of 2022, when the estimated death rates went as high or higher than they were at the time of the Delta variant surge in the previous autumn.\\n\\nCan vaccination prevent it? The CDC says that while breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are expected, staying up to date with vaccinations is the best protection against Omicron. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of a new fall 2023 updated COVID-19 booster against EG.5 and BA.2.86, according to the CDC. Currently, the CDC says the updated vaccine is expected to be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization from the two recent subvariants.', 'There are several things about the coronavirus epidemic that are not very well understood, or explained by the facts at hand. For example, the unexpected five-month long decline in cases in India starting in mid-September last year. An even bigger surprise has been the ferocity of the second wave that has seen the daily count of cases in India soaring to more than four lakh.\\n\\nLack of ‘Covid-appropriate behaviour’ has been cited as one of the main reasons for the rapid rise in infections from March. But that is only part of the explanation. Even during the five-month lull, the adoption of masks wasn’t universal, nor was physical distancing being strictly followed. Election rallies have also been blamed, but these do not explain the phenomenal rise in cases in states such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab or Karnataka that had no elections. In any case, the second wave had started much before the large political rallies began to take place.\\n\\nNewsletter | Click to get the day’s best explainers in your inbox\\n\\nThe newer variants\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScientists have also been examining whether biological changes in the virus had anything to do with the unprecedented surge in infections in the last two months. Viruses mutate, and mutations that help it survive and circulate better are selected. In the last few months, several new variants of the virus have been found to be circulating in the Indian population.\\n\\nA few of these have greater transmissibility, meaning they have a better ability to infect human beings. One particular variant, called B.1.617, first found in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, has received a lot of attention because of its ability to transmit at a faster rate and, possibly, also to evade the immune response. Other fast-transmitting variants, such as the one that first emerged in the United Kingdom, called B 1.1.7, that has been found to be present in large numbers in northern India, could also be the reasons for the rapid rise in cases.\\n\\nSteep rise in new cases since March Steep rise in new cases since March\\n\\nWhile scientists acknowledge that these new variants could have contributed to the surge in cases, they have reluctant to say that these are the main cause for the ferocity of the second wave. They have been maintaining that the epidemiological evidence is still not clinching enough. On Wednesday, the government, for the first time, linked the B.1.617 variant with the surge seen in some states. But it reiterated that the clinical and epidemiological correlation was still not fully established.\\n\\nNot the same everywhere\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnurag Agrawal, director of Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said while the new variants had been found to be circulating in many parts of the country, not every surge in cases could be attributed to these. Even within a state, the spread of the virus in some areas could be directly because of these faster-transmitting variants, while in others some other factor could be responsible.\\n\\n“In Maharashtra, for example, the rise in cases in the Vidarbha region can possibly be explained by the emergence of the B.1.617 variant. But this variant does not explain the surge in Mumbai. That is because this variant has not been found in adequate numbers in the Mumbai population. There, the main reason for the rise could be something else… reopening of the local trains, possibly, in the month of February,” he said.\\n\\nIn Kerala, the new variant that is predominantly in circulation is N440K. But Agrawal said the surge in Kerala could not be attributed to this. “The locations where we found this variant were not the same where the maximum cases were getting reported from. In fact, the surge was found to be the maximum in areas where the presence of this variant was the least,” he said.\\n\\nIn Punjab and Haryana, however, there is little doubt about the cause of the surge. In both the states, the UK variant is predominant. In a recent study, more than 80% of the samples taken from infected people in Punjab were found to be of this variant. Neighbouring Delhi also has a large proportion of the UK variant, but in keeping with the character of the national capital which has people coming in from across the country, nearly every variant circulating in other states has marked a presence in Delhi as well. And there are hundreds of them, most of them having little or no impact on the rise in cases.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScientists say that in most places, a surge or a decline in cases can only be explained by a combination of factors. Almost every state has one variant or the other present, but in many places these have had no role in causing the increase in cases. As one of the scientists explained, epidemics are like complex systems where very small changes in inputs, or initial conditions, can lead to dramatic and unexpected outputs. So, at some places, even a large number of wedding gatherings on a particular day could be the reason for a prolonged surge. The exponential nature of the spread of an epidemic makes this possible.\\n\\nVariants under watch\\n\\nYet, the new variants are under close watch right now. The government has already classified the B.1.617 as a ‘variant of concern’ though that tag is still to be attached to it officially by the World Health Organization. As reported by this newspaper, this particular variant has undergone further mutations, and at least three different sub-variants, named B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3, are supposed to have the potential to spread even faster, and cause bigger damage than the parent variant.\\n\\nAgrawal said these three new variants were a cause of concern. “I am worried about the B.1.617, and the three new ones emerging from it. I am worried about the UK variant, and also the South African variant. But I am not too much worried about the Brazilian variant, or the B.1.618, or even the N440K. I am currently worried only about the variants that have the potential to cause explosive rise in cases,” he said.'], similarity=0.0)]),\n",

This, along with recent strong US economic indicators suggests that interest rates might not be cut as some hoped,\" Neha Qureshi, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at Anand Rathi Commodities & Currencies said.Higher interest rates can have a negative impact on non-yielding gold.On the daily chart, MCX April gold contracts have formed an inverted hammer candlestick pattern indicating bearishness and with the RSI remaining in the overbought territory, a potential retracement in prices cannot be ruled out, Qureshi said. A surge beyond the 65,800 mark would solidify the bearish outlook, the Anand Rathi Analyst said as she puts key resistance levels at 66,440 -Rs 66,900 while support at Rs 65,550- Rs 65,050.The prices have risen by 5.67% or Rs 3,547 on MCX on a month-to-date basis, Anuj Gupta, Head Commodity & Currency, HDFC Securities said. On the year-to-date basis, the uptick is Rs 2,911 or 4.61%. As for the Silver contract, the MTD gains stand at 4.54% or Rs 3,239 while the YTD gains at 0.12% or Rs 88, Gupta added.Gupta sees MCX gold trading at Rs 65,500- Rs 66500 levels while silver at Rs 74,000-Rs 75,500.Price of gold in major physical bullion markets like Delhi, Ahmedabad and other cities is Rs 66,300 per 10 gram while those of 1 kg of Silver is Rs 76,000, Gupta said.– Sell MCX April gold futures at Rs 66,100 with a stop loss of Rs 66,500 and a price target of Rs 65,600.– Sell MCX May silver futures at Rs 74,500 with a stop loss of Rs 75,500 and a price target of Rs 72,500.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Year on year, gold is up 16.5%.\\n\\nInvestors who expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate are the main force driving up prices, but the surge is boosted by other factors, including central banks — led by China — buying up gold to ease reliance on US dollars.\\n\\nCentral banks see gold as a long-term store of value and a safe haven during times of economic and international turmoil.\\n\\nGold is considered a resilient investment. When interest rates fall, gold prices tend to rise, as bullion becomes more appealing than income-paying assets like bonds. Investors also regard gold as a hedge against inflation, betting bullion will retain its value when prices rise.\\n\\nThe People’s Bank of China bought gold for the 17th straight month in March, adding 160,000 ounces to bring reserves to 72.74 million troy ounces of gold, according to Reuters.\\n\\nCentral banks may want to “diversify away” from US dollars and buy gold amid geopolitical uncertainty, according to an April 9 UBS research note.

India’s GDP growth is driving those purchases, according to UBS.\\n\\nA sign of the times?\\n\\nCentral banks demanding gold is a sign of waning reliance on the dollar, according to Ulf Lindahl, CEO at Currency Research Associates.\\n\\nDollars are increasingly unappealing for central banks who want to decrease economic reliance on the US, Lindahl said in an email.\\n\\nNations not allied with the US may accumulate gold to “mix away from dollars” to reduce vulnerability to sanctions, according to a March JP Morgan research note.\\n\\nCentral bank buying has driven the rise in gold prices since 2022, according to the note.

The index, which Fed officials view as a crucial gauge of underlying inflation, was down from 0.4% in January, when it had grown at the fastest pace in one year.\\n\\nSo why is gold surging right now?\\n\\nSome investors are buying into the hype around gold bullion as prices rise, pushing them further up. On Reddit, proud gold buyers often post threads about their stashes.\\n\\nCostco began selling gold bars online in August and silver coins in January. The company may now be selling as much as $200 million in gold and silver each month, according to an estimate by Wells Fargo. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told analysts in December that the company had sold more than $100 million of gold bars in the prior quarter.\\n\\n“The accelerating frequency of Reddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and [the company’s] robust monthly eComm sales suggests a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch,” the April 9 investment note said.\\n\\nLindahl said that “trend followers” and others jump on the rise in prices as the background begins to point to substantially higher prices over the long term.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that gold is a traditional asset to hold during political uncertainty. Voters in more than 60 countries are set to head to the polls this year, including for the US presidential election. That uptick in geopolitical and economic unpredictability underscores the precious metal’s stable value.', 'The price of gold has climbed 17% in 2024.\\n\\nShoppers are flocking to Costco for gold bars but they\\'re hardly the only ones scooping up the precious metal.\\n\\nInvestors drove gold prices to a record high on Friday, the latest surge in a 17% rally so far this year.

That trend, he added, suggests retail investors are not a major cause of the price increase.\\n\\nShoppers outside a Costco store in Bayonne, NJ, Dec. 9, 2023. Angus Mordant/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nGold is also widely viewed as a hedge against geopolitical unrest because the millennia-old store of value is perceived as an investment that could outlive calamity.\\n\\nWorld Gold Council, a United Kingdom-based trade association for the gold industry, said global disruption could drive up prices this year, according to a January report.\\n\\n\"In addition to monetary policy, geopolitical uncertainty is often a key driver of gold demand and in 2024 we expect this to have a pronounced impact on the market,\" the World Gold Council report said.\\n\\nFor his part, Harvey cast doubt on the role of geopolitics in the price surge, since the onset of the rally did not coincide with the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war in October.\\n\\nInvestors aiming to put money in gold can do it in a variety of ways. In addition to purchasing the gold bars on offer at some stores like Costco, investors can put funds into a variety of gold ETFs or buy shares in gold mining companies.\\n\\nIndividuals can also invest in gold futures, contracts to buy or sell gold on an agreed-upon date, which essentially amount to a bet on the movement of the price.\\n\\nInvestors should beware, however, Harvey said, noting that bullion typically generates modest returns over the period following an all-time high. UBS expects the price of gold to tick up to $2,500 by the end of the year, according to its report last week.\\n\\n\"Investing at an all-time high is very risky,\" Harvey said.\\n\\nReporters at Good Morning America contributed to this report.'], similarity=0.0)]),\n",

Burning fossil fuels and destroying forests have caused inestimable environmental harm by producing a warming effect through the artificial concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has risen by 50 percent in the past 200 years, much of it since the 1970s, raising in turn the Earth’s temperature by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nIndeed, since the 1970s, the decade which saw the rise of neoliberalism as the dominant economic ideology in the Western world, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90 percent. Unsurprisingly, average temperatures have risen more quickly over the past few decades, and the last 10 years have been the warmest years on record. In fact, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration analysis has confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, and all indications are that 2024 could be even hotter than 2023. In March, scientists at Copernicus Climate Change Service said that February 2024 was the hottest February, according to records going back to 1940.\\n\\nThe world is now warming faster than any point in recorded history. Yet, while the science of climate change is well established and we know both the causes and the effects of global warming, the rulers of the world are showing no signs of discontinuing their destructive activities that are putting Earth on track to becoming uninhabitable for humans. Emissions from Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s utter destruction of Gaza will undoubtedly have a significant effect on climate change. Analysis by researchers in the United Kingdom and United States reveals that the majority of global emissions generated in the first two months of the Israeli invasion of Gaza can be attributed to the aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Indeed, the destruction of Gaza is so immense that it exceeds, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II.\\n\\nFurther evidence that the rulers of the world view themselves as being separate and distinct from the world around them (in spite of the fact that all life on Earth is at risk) came during the recent CERAWeek oil summit in Houston, Texas, where executives from the world’s leading fossil fuel companies said that we should “abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas.” Who from the likes of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies gives a damn if the emissions from the burning of fossil fuels until 2050 causes millions of deaths before the end of the century? Oil and gas companies made tens of billions in annual net profit in 2023 as they continued to expand fossil fuel production.\\n\\nOf course, none of the above is to suggest that the game is over. The rulers of the world (powerful states, huge corporations, and the financial elite) are always pulling out all the stops to resist change and maintain the status quo. But common people are fighting back, and history has repeatedly shown that they will never surrender to the forces of reaction and oppression. We have seen a remarkable escalation of climate and political activism in general over the past several years — indeed, a sharp awakening of global public consciousness to the interconnectedness of challenges in the 21st century that leaves much room for hope about the future. Struggles against climate change are connected to the fight against imperialism, inequality, poverty and injustice. These struggles are not in vain, even when the odds seem stacked against them. On the contrary, they have produced some remarkable results.\\n\\nDeforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest is falling dramatically since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva came into office — a victory not only for the Brazilian people but for those across the world who care about the environment and justice. In North America, Indigenous communities scored major victories in 2023 in the struggle for conservation, protecting hundreds of thousands of acres of forest land and sacred and culturally significant sites from mining. Climate activists in Europe and the U.S. won major legal victories throughout 2023, such as the youth victory against the state of Montana. Similar climate litigation like Juliana v. United States is only expected to grow in 2024. As actor and climate activist Jane Fonda aptly put it on “Fire Drill Fridays,” a video program that was launched in 2019 by Fonda herself in collaboration with Greenpeace USA, “These lawsuits are not just legal maneuvers … but are at the crux of climate reckoning.”\\n\\nThese victories for our planet are more than enough proof that activism pays off and should be an acute reminder that the kind of transformational change we need will not start at the top. In 2018, the climate protest of a 15-year-old Swedish student captured the imagination of her own country and eventually “aroused the world,” to use the words of British broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. Indeed, just a year later, Greta Thunberg would be credited with leading the biggest climate protest in history.\\n\\nIt is grassroots environmental activism that created the political space for President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — the largest investment in clean energy and climate action in U.S. history. (It’s important to point out that the law stripped out many social and economic programs in the original draft that are critical for low-income communities and communities of color, and the law lacks a deep decarbonization pathway.) Environmental movements such as Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, and Letzte Generation have sparked a global conversation on the climate crisis and have opened up new possibilities for forcing the transition away from fossil fuels across Europe even in the face of a growing backlash by hard-line conservative and far right groups, and even as European governments crack down on climate protests.\\n\\nThe rulers of the world won’t save the planet. They have a vested interest in maintaining the existing state of affairs, whether it be oppression of the weak or continued reliance on fossil fuels. Radical political action is our only hope because voting alone will never solve our problems. Organizing communities, raising awareness and educating the public, and developing convincing accounts of change are key elements for creating real progress in politics. Indeed, as the recent history of environmental politics shows, climate activism is the pathway to climate defense.\\n\\nTired of reading the same old news from the same old sources? So are we!

Most of the data is compiled by University of Maryland researchers.\\n\\nDeclining forest loss in Brazil and Colombia was largely offset by greater losses elsewhere, Global Forest Watch director Mikaela Weisse told a press briefing.\\n\\n\"The world took two steps forward, two steps back,\" Weisse said.\\n\\nScientists consider tropical primary forests to be among the most precious as their lush vegetation is the most densely packed with carbon.

That is in spite of destruction in Brazil falling 36%, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pursued aggressive conservation policies, particularly regarding the Amazon, Weisse said.\\n\\nNeighboring Colombia experienced a 49% drop in forest loss. President Gustavo Petro made environmental preservation a key part of the peace process with armed groups that dominate jungle areas, Weisse noted.\\n\\nForest destruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo remained relatively stable but high at around 1,930 square miles.\\n\\nIn third place, Bolivia experienced record-high primary forest loss for the third year in a row, with destruction surging 27%.

Deforestation refers to people permanently converting woodlands to other uses such as agriculture and is harder to measure.\\n\\nMore than 140 countries in 2021 committed to end deforestation by the end of the decade, a goal that requires huge declines in destruction each year, World Resources Institute forests director Rod Taylor said.\\n\\n\"We are far off track and trending in the wrong direction when it comes to reducing global deforestation,\" Taylor said.\\n\\nBrazil, Indonesia and Bolivia led in deforestation, followed closely by the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\nCANADA WILDFIRES OFF THE CHARTS\\n\\nTree cover loss increased 24% in all forests globally in 2022, mostly because of enormous wildfires in Canada.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nCanada\\'s forest loss of more than 80,000 square km (30,900 square miles) was three times higher than any year on record, offsetting a decline in forest loss in the rest of the world.\\n\\n\"That is one of the biggest anomalies on record,\" University of Maryland researcher Matt Hansen said.\\n\\nWhile deforestation in the tropics is a human-caused driver of climate change, the fires in Canada are more of a symptom of global warming, which leads to the hotter, drier conditions that fuel bigger blazes.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a big deal, and it\\'s a cautionary tale for climate impacts to fire,\" Hansen said.', 'Taking Charge: Three Actions to Help Combat Climate Change and Save Amazonia\\n\\nNEW YORK, Apr 4 2024 (IPS) - Climate change is the defining crisis of our time––it is the ultimate equalizer from which no one is immune. The Earth’s ecosystems are on the brink of collapse, threatening biodiversity and human societies in unprecedented ways at a global scale.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe planet is currently experiencing the warmest years on record, accompanied by a rise in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. As a “threat multiplier,” the climate crisis will continue to exacerbate already existing challenges.\\n\\nThese challenges include the alteration of 75% of the land surface and 55% of the ocean, the destruction of 32 million hectares of tropical forests between 2010 and 2015, and the thousandfold increase in species extinction rates.\\n\\nThese interconnected crises, linked to culture, education, economics, politics, and the environment, pose an urgent existential threat to humanity.\\n\\nAmazonia plays a crucial role in the global fight against climate change. Home to approximately 47 million people, 2.2 million of whom are Indigenous, and housing more than 10% of the planet’s biodiversity, it stands as the world’s largest river basin and megadiverse tropical forest.\\n\\nThis region serves as a global repository of natural resources, providing essential ecosystem services to the entire planet, including water and nutrient recycling, mediation of infectious diseases, ecotourism, and food production.\\n\\nAmazonian forests act as a colossal “air-conditioner,” reducing land surface temperatures and generating rainfall. They influence atmospheric circulation within and outside the tropics through the maintenance of aerial rivers, shaping moisture patterns across South America and contributing to the largest river discharge on Earth.\\n\\nFurthermore, Amazonia helps regulate global biogeochemical and atmospheric cycles, serving as a key buffer against climate change by storing about 150-200 billion tons of carbon in its soils and vegetation.\\n\\nYet, the region faces intense extraction processes endangering its ecosystems and peoples. Deforestation, habitat fragmentation, the overexploitation of natural resources, the expansion of large-scale infrastructure, and pollution (particularly mercury pollution) pose significant threats to Amazonia’s rich socio-biodiversity.\\n\\nMoreover, Amazonia is approximately 1.1°C warmer than it was 40 years ago, and the increased frequency of extreme climate events, like the recent record-breaking droughts, are wreaking havoc on Amazonian terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and local communities. These factors place the region’s plants and animals at high risk of extinction, undermine carbon storage and sequestration, and diminish resilience.\\n\\nIf current trends continue, Amazonia will be pushed closer to crossing a point of no return, or “tipping point,” a state in which continuous forests can no longer exist and are replaced by degraded, open canopy ecosystems.\\n\\nCrossing a tipping point would unleash potentially irreversible cascading effects, accelerating global warming, leading to decreased aerial rivers, droughts and heatwaves in central South America, and mass species extinctions.\\n\\nAddressing the climate and biodiversity crises––including by conserving Amazonia and preventing it from reaching a tipping point––requires implementing solutions that match the magnitude of the challenges faced.\\n\\nAchieving a “Living Amazon,” reaching climate stability and protecting biodiversity, requires urgent action across multiple scales to limit the rise in global temperatures by mid-century and eliminate deforestation, degradation, and wildfires in Amazonia by 2030.\\n\\nThe complexity of these crises cannot be addressed by placing the sole responsibility on governments and industry. Doing so demands both bottom-up and top-down actions, systemic transformations of our production and consumption systems, and significant restoration efforts.\\n\\nActions at the individual, household, and community levels have been proven to be more impactful than many realize. While individuals often feel hopeless about their ability to influence change on a large scale, the collective impact of individual behavior change, when adopted by billions of people, can make a decisive difference.\\n\\nHere, three impactful actions are presented that individuals can integrate into their daily lives to help combat climate change and save Amazonia.\\n\\nAction 1: Adopting Mindful Daily Habits\\n\\nSimple daily choices can influence the health of Amazonia. Minimizing food waste and switching to plant-based meals cuts emissions alleviates pressure on forests and land used for cattle ranching and animal feed production, aiding in the fight against deforestation.\\n\\nBy being aware of product origins, individuals can also support responsible sourcing practices and sustainable value chains that benefit both the environment and local communities in Amazonia. Through these actions, individuals help bolster socio-bioeconomies and empower Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs).\\n\\nAction 2: Expanding Knowledge of the Amazon\\n\\nEngaging with educational resources, like the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA)’s massive open online course, “The Living Amazon: Science, Cultures and Sustainability in Practice,” can deepen individuals’ understanding of the threats the Amazon faces and how to be part of the solution.\\n\\nAction 3: Advocate for Amazonia\\n\\nRaising awareness and advocating for policies promoting conservation, Indigenous rights and knowledge, and sustainable development are crucial to protecting Amazonia and addressing climate change. This includes advocating for the implementation of nature-based solutions, such as the Arcs of Restoration, a socio-bioeconomy of healthy standing forests and flowing rivers, and the bioindustrialization of forest products.\\n\\nSupporting political candidates who prioritize climate action, environmental conservation, and the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities can also play a critical role in the development of policies and regulations that conserve Amazonia in the years to come.\\n\\nWhen reflecting on this upcoming Earth Day (on April 22) the challenges facing the planet, it is essential to remember that systemic change begins with individual actions. The actions outlined here––adopting mindful daily habits, expanding knowledge, and advocating for Amazonia––collectively form a powerful force for positive change.\\n\\nTogether, these actions symbolize a shared commitment to a more sustainable future, where Amazonia and the planet can thrive.\\n\\nJulie Topf is Program Associate, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Gabriela Arnal is Communications Consultant, Science Panel for the Amazon.\\n\\nIPS UN Bureau'], similarity=0.0), Origin(name='Google', url=['https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/10/brazil-record-deforestation-amazon-rainforest-lula-bolsonaro#:~:text=Government%20satellites%20show%20that%20a,the%20month%20since%20records%20began.', 'https://news.mongabay.com/2023/06/the-amazon-saw-record-deforestation-last-year-heres-why/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67962297'], data=['Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest rose in February to the highest level on record for the month, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing the administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as it tries to undo the environmental destruction wreaked under the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro.\\n\\nGovernment satellites show that a record 322 sq km of Amazon rainforest were destroyed in February, a 62% increase on last year and the highest number for the month since records began.\\n\\nLula, who took office on 1 January this year, has pledged to end illegal logging after deforestation soared to a 15-year high during the Bolsonaro years.\\n\\nWith the environment ministry once again led by the environmentalist Marina Silva, who oversaw a sharp drop in deforestation in the same role during Lula’s first term in office, the government has reactivated the Amazon Fund, a key tool for preservation, and recreated a civil society council on the environment – both abandoned under Bolsonaro.\\n\\nSilva has also brushed off and updated a deforestation prevention and control plan that formed the backbone of her successful policies nearly two decades ago.\\n\\nThese are important steps, but “innovation is necessary, as the Amazon today is not the same as it was 10, 20 years ago”, said a Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson, Rômulo Batista.\\n\\nCrime and violence exploded under the previous government, as Bolsonaro’s disdain for the rainforest and the people who protect it emboldened criminals of all kinds, including the killers of the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Addressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist, a process which cannot happen overnight, said Batista.\\n\\n“The land grabber, the deforester, the illegal miner, they are making the most of this time to rush to cut the forest down,” Batista said.\\n\\nAfter preliminary data pointed towards the jump in destruction in February, Silva told reporters last month that loggers were working even during the Amazon’s rainy season as a “sort of revenge” against the current government’s crackdown.\\n\\nDeforestation figures are typically lower at the start of the year, as the Amazon rainy season hinders forest clearing and cloud cover means satellites are less likely to pick up on it. For this reason, analysts had cautioned against celebrating a drop in deforestation in January.', 'An estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021.\\n\\nIt was the worst year for deforestation since 2004, according to Amazon Conservation’s Monitoring of the Amazon Project (MAAP), which analyzed satellite readings from Global Forest Watch.\\n\\nThe deforestation was caused by cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.\\n\\nLast year, the Amazon saw some of the highest rates of deforestation in over a decade, due to a combination of cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects that cleared millions of acres of rainforest.\\n\\nAn estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021 and the highest figure on record except for 2004, when over 2 million hectares (about 5 million acres) were lost.\\n\\n“The 2022 deforestation data is a stark reminder that we are in a race against time for the Amazon. With deforestation rates the highest they have been since 2004, the ecological integrity of the Amazon is in jeopardy,” said Leila Salazar-López, executive director of Amazon Watch.\\n\\nThe figures come from Global Forest Watch satellite readings on deforestation and fire hotspots, which were processed and published in a report by Amazon Conservation’s Monitoring of the Amazon Project (MAAP).\\n\\nAll six countries that share the Amazon Rainforest — Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela — experienced deforestation last year, but none of them were hit as hard as Brazil. It lost a total of 1.4 million hectares (3.45 million acres) of primary forest, making it the worst year of deforestation since a historic peak between 2002 and 2005.\\n\\nFormer President Jair Bolsonaro, who left office at the end of last year, has been accused of worsening deforestation by failing to demarcate a single Indigenous territory while at the same time encouraging economic activity in the rainforest that led to some of the highest greenhouse gas emissions in years.\\n\\nSatellite readings show that a lot of the forest loss is concentrated around roads, most notably the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the states of Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia and Acre. The incomplete BR-319 highway, connecting Manaus to Porto Velho, has been criticized by conservationists who say the road will open up more areas of the rainforest to human activity.\\n\\nThe country with the second-worst deforestation was Bolivia, which saw 245,177 hectares (605,845 acres) of deforestation last year, by far the highest rate for the country on record. It was a 47% jump from 2021. Fires also directly impacted another 106,922 hectares (264,210 acres).\\n\\nThe deforestation was mostly driven by soy production in the southeast department of Santa Cruz, according to MAAP. The country has also seen a growing presence of Mennonite communities over the last two decades, with much of the land being encroached upon under questionable legal circumstances.\\n\\nPeru is also struggling with a Mennonite problem in the central Amazon. A separate MAAP report last year found that various colonies were responsible for nearly 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of deforestation. And while that and gold mining have received the most attention from policymakers and conservationists, the data suggests that much of the 144,682 hectares (357,517 acres) lost last year in Peru actually came from small-scale agriculture.\\n\\n“We focus on the most obvious cases, like the gold mining and the Mennonites,” said Matt Finer, MAAP director and senior research specialist at Amazon Conservation. “We really target those cases because they’re important, but then you still have this 90% that’s a slow death by a thousand cuts — the expansion that no one really has a handle on.”\\n\\nColombia saw 97,417 hectares (240,722 acres) of deforestation last year, making it the only country to experience a decrease from the previous year, albeit by just 2%. Most of it took place in a corridor that cuts through the central departments of Caquetá, Meta, and Guaviare. Protected areas there — such as Chiribiquete National Park and Nukak Maku Indigenous reserve — have been fending off cattle ranchers and guerrilla groups.\\n\\nEcuador, although having a much smaller piece of the Amazon than the other countries, suffered a proportionally higher spike in deforestation. It lost 18,902 hectares (46,707 acres) last year — up 80% from 2021. In addition to mining, much of that can be attributed to palm oil and other agricultural plantations.\\n\\nNow moving into 2023, there’s some concern that the El Niño warm front will exacerbate fires and increase forest loss for the year. But there’s also hope that a change in government in Brazil — now under the more environmentally friendly President Lula da Silva — will lower deforestation rates for much of the Amazon.\\n\\n“We’re optimistic about things going down in Brazil with Lula,” Finer said. “But I still think the rest of the Amazon is still much lower profile. I don’t think many aren’t paying enough attention to what’s going on.”\\n\\nBanner image: The Peruvian Amazon. Photo by Rhett A.

A 2015 analysis6 of 321 plots of Amazon primary forest with no overt human impacts reported “a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation”. A similar study7 published in 2020 reported the same things in the Congo Basin forest — the world’s second-largest tropical jungle.\\n\\nThat’s a change from previous decades, when censuses indicated that such primary forest in the Amazon was storing more carbon. There is no consensus explanation for these slowdowns, or why primary forest was accumulating carbon. But many researchers suspect that the carbon gains in previous decades stem from the influence of extra CO 2 in the atmosphere, which can stimulate the growth of plants. In some studies that expose large forest plots to elevated CO 2 , known as free-air carbon enrichment (FACE) experiments, researchers have measured gains in biomass. But this effect lasted only a few years in one experiment8, and other studies have not yet determined whether the gains are temporary.\\n\\nAll of the forest FACE experiments have so far been conducted in temperate regions, however. And many scientists suspect that tropical forests — and the Amazon, in particular — might follow different rules. The first tropical-forest FACE experiment is finally under construction, 50 kilometres north of Manaus. Nobre says that it could help to predict whether continued increases in CO 2 will benefit the Amazon.\\n\\nFor several decades, Nobre and his students have used computer models to forecast how climate change and deforestation will affect the Amazon. The research grew, in part, from work in the 1970s showing that the Amazon forest itself helps to create the conditions that nourish it9. Moisture blowing in from the Atlantic falls as rain in the eastern Amazon and is then transpired and blown farther west. It recycles several times before reaching the Andes. A smaller or seriously degraded forest would recycle less water, and eventually might not be able to support the lush, humid forest.\\n\\nIn their 2016 study2, Nobre and several colleagues estimated the Amazon would reach a tipping point if the planet warms by more than 2.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures and if 20–25% of the Amazon is deforested. The planet is on track to reach 2.5 °C of warming by 2100, according to a report released by the United Nations last October.\\n\\nNobre now wonders whether his earlier study was too conservative. “What Luciana Gatti’s paper shows is that this whole area in the southern Amazon is becoming a carbon source.” He is convinced that, although the Amazon is not at the tipping point yet, it might be soon.\\n\\nSusan Trumbore, director of the Max Planck Institute of Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany, is not a fan of using the term tipping point, a phrase with no precise definition, to discuss the Amazon. But she says that the forest’s future is in question. “We all think of a tipping point as it’s going to happen and it’s going to happen fast. I have a feeling that it’s going to be a gradual alteration of the ecosystem that we know is coming with climate change,” she says. Regardless of whether the change will be fast or slow, Trumbore agrees with the majority of scientists who study the Amazon that it is facing serious challenges that might have global ramifications.', '\"I don\\'t think that [tipping point] is what we are seeing [yet], at least in all but the driest part of the Amazon forest,\" says Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the latest study.', 'Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\\n\\nThe study suggests that 10% to 47% of the landscape is at risk of transitioning away from rainforest by 2050 if warming and rates of deforestation aren’t dramatically curbed.\\n\\n“So many stressors are intensifying — climatic ones and land use stressors — when you combine these, they all end up causing water stress in the forest,” said Bernardo Flores, a lead author of the paper who is an ecologist and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Santa Catarina, in Florianópolis, Brazil. “It can reach a point where the forest is no longer capable of persisting.”\\n\\nThe Amazon contains about 10% of the world’s land-based biodiversity and stores incredible amounts of carbon in its dense trees. The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.\\n\\nFlores said that the changes outlined in the study are already happening but that he was optimistic they could be slowed or even halted.\\n\\n“I’m hoping in this paper, our findings will show the urgency if we don’t act within the next 30 years,” Flores said.\\n\\nThe study focuses on overlapping stressors to the Amazon, namely from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires. It describes how those factors could combine to break down the Amazon’s water and carbon cycles.\\n\\n“The Amazon is massive and maintains its own water cycle,” said Ernesto Alvarado, a research associate professor at the University of Washington’s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, who was not involved in the study. “If the balance breaks, it’s a major problem.”\\n\\nIf deforestation, wildfires, droughts and climate change reduce the amount of forested land that absorbs water, less moisture would be available to the atmosphere from plants, reducing the amount of rain to sustain the landscape.\\n\\nAbout 15% of the Amazon has already been lost, Flores said.'], similarity=0.0)])]"

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) covered selected events that took place on 1 December, alongside the World Climate Action Summit.\\n\\nA high-level roundtable celebrated the one-year anniversary of the International Drought Resilience Alliance (IDRA), which was launched at UNFCCC COP 27 in November 2022, during the Leaders’ Summit. The Alliance is under the leadership of Macky Sall, President of Senegal, and Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain.\\n\\nIn opening remarks, Sánchez mentioned tangible results during the Alliance’s first year, including: six new countries – Australia, Colombia, the Comoros, Italy, Paraguay, and Uruguay – joining IDRA; publications such as the Global Drought Snapshot 2023 Report, launched at COP 28; and developing new financial mechanisms to leverage funds. He announced that Spain will host a high-level meeting on droughts in 2024.\\n\\nIbrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary, UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), noted that while droughts were once viewed as only affecting some regions, they are now a global threat, impacting on livelihoods and ecosystems and fueling displacement and conflicts.\\n\\nHindou Oumarou Ibrahim, speaking for the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad, noted the ripple effects of drought, which has doubled the cost of food and produced and led to more household debt.\\n\\nOther speakers, including the Presidents of Mauritania and Senegal, highlighted that droughts affect 1.84 billion people throughout the world, with 85% of them living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). They also emphasized:\\n\\ninterlinkages between conflicts and droughts, noting one can exacerbate the other;\\n\\nour improper use of freshwater – an intersectional issue that impacts agriculture and food production;\\n\\nIDRA as a useful tool for collective efforts to restore and sustainably manage soil;\\n\\nthe need to reinforce the capacities of youth, including young women; and\\n\\nthe need to ensure that UNCCD is given the same platforms and attention as the other Rio Conventions, and is not marginalized.\\n\\nThe event was organized by the UNCCD Secretariat and IDRA.\\n\\nAnother high-level event, convened by the Government of Botswana and supported by the UN Science-Policy-Business Forum (UN-SPBF), addressed the climate crisis and human settlements nexus in Africa. It explored integrated, cooperative multilateral approaches to tackle some of Africa’s pressing climate challenges.\\n\\nDuring the event, President of Botswana Mokgweetsi Masisi highlighted the need for smart investments promoting value addition in the transition away from fossil fuels and harnessing the continent’s potential in solar energy. He said while returns on investment are part of the solution, “reparations must be a driving principle” as well.\\n\\nOther speakers, including the President of Namibia, referred to: the operationalization of the loss and damage fund at COP 28 as a huge step forward; the need to fill the finance gap to the required USD 1.8 trillion before 2030 and for rapid disbursements to developing countries; knowledge and data to ensure targeted responses consider specific needs of each community; and efforts to promote a holistic, cross-ministerial approach to sustainable development.\\n\\nAnother event saw the launch of the Multilevel Action & Urbanization Pavilion. Co-convened by UN-Habitat and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), this event highlighted interlinkages between urbanization, climate change, and people and communities at the frontlines of climate change.\\n\\nAddressing participants former US Vice President Al Gore compared the climate movement to the “great moral-based” movements of the past, such as the civil right and women’s suffrage movements in the US.\\n\\nKatrin Jammeh, ICLEI, pointed out that, while cities account for 70% of emissions, the local level receives less than 15% of global funding.\\n\\nDuring a Multi-level Action Dialogue, speakers noted:\\n\\nthe potential of local efforts to create a domino effect leading to positive change at a global scale;\\n\\na Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, initiative to create a clean truck programme that was bolstered by state and federal funding and inspired global efforts to implement green shipping;\\n\\nBrazil’s reduction of deforestation by 40% in 2023, while increasing affordable housing, creating jobs, and developing sustainable infrastructure in Amazonian cities; and\\n\\nthe SusHi Tech Tokyo 2024 initiative in pursuit of Tokyo’s commitment to halve their carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.\\n\\nHighlighting agriculture as the primary sector impacted by loss and damage due to climate change-related events, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) organized an event looking at loss and damage in agrifood systems.\\n\\nFAO Director General QU Dongyu emphasized the need for, among others, innovations in information management to measure loss and damage and build efficiency in agrifood systems.\\n\\nDuring the event, FAO launched a report titled, ‘Loss and Damage in Agrifood Systems: Addressing Gaps and Challenges,’ which highlights the need for improved methodologies to track loss and damage, increase investment in data collection, and increase financing. The report indicates that the agriculture sector is losing, on average, USD 123 billion per year due to disaster events, but that data on climate-related loss and damage are “scant or non-existent.”\\n\\nA Youth, Indigenous Peoples, and First Nations representative pointed to the inability of Indigenous Peoples in Canada to access the loss and damage fund because they live in a developed country.\\n\\nOther speakers highlighted that: Indigenous Peoples should have a seat at the table as they are rights holders; slow-onset events, such as increasing water salinity and drought, often become more prominent as their effects reverberate across economic sectors; and data harmonization can connect “the local to the global.”', 'Reminders of the war in Gaza punctuated the speeches on Friday at the annual United Nations climate summit on a day when fighting between Israel and Hamas resumed after a weeklong cease-fire. Isaac Herzog, the president of Israel, and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, were both scheduled to address the summit, but neither spoke.\\n\\nNevertheless, other Middle Eastern heads of state used their time to speak in support of the Palestinians.\\n\\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan almost immediately turned his speech to the war in Gaza, calling attention to more than 13,000 Palestinian civilians killed by Israel’s military campaign, according to Gazan health authorities, and saying that leaders should not talk about climate change “in isolation from the humanitarian tragedies unfolding around us.”\\n\\n“As we speak, the Palestinian people are facing an immediate threat to their lives and well-being,” King Abdullah said. “In a region already on the front lines of climate change, the massive destruction of war makes the environmental threats of water scarcity and food insecurity even more severe.”\\n\\nThe more than two million Palestinians trapped in Gaza have spent much of the past two months searching desperately for food and water as the Israeli military laid siege to the territory, which is run by Hamas, the armed group that led the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel that killed around 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities.\\n\\nAs the war threatens to metastasize into a wider regional conflict, Jordan, which borders Israel and the West Bank, is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to spillover. Much of the country’s population is of Palestinian descent, and fury toward Israel and the United States has swept across the Middle East since the outbreak of the war.\\n\\nSpeaking at the climate summit, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey condemned the Israeli military campaign as a “war crime.”\\n\\n“While we are here expressing our views on the climate crisis, it is impossible not to touch upon the humanitarian crisis taking place in the Palestinian territories close to us,” he said.\\n\\nThe president of Iraq, Abdul Latif Rashid, also called for protections for civilians and said he supported Palestinians’ “right to self-determination.”\\n\\nTheir remarks stood out partly for their setting: The summit’s host, the United Arab Emirates, led a push for Arab countries to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 in an American-brokered deal called the Abraham Accords. The Emirati government has maintained those ties throughout the war, even as the Israeli military campaign sparked grief and anger among Emirati citizens.\\n\\nOn social media, Mr. Herzog shared photographs from the sidelines of the summit. He met with world leaders, including the Emirati president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, and shook hands with the Qatari ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, whose country had mediated the cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\\n\\nIt was unclear whether Mr. Herzog and Mr. Abbas would speak on Saturday as the summit continues.'], similarity=0.45413678884506226), Origin(name='Bing', url=['https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-antonio-guterres-climate-and-environment-f6e008b4e7956d6e1356a8e3e26789cf', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59105878', 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/13/climate/cop26-glasgow-climate-summit'], data=['UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief warned Monday that the world is failing to address the “existential threat” from global warning and announced that he will convene a “Climate Action Summit” in September to accelerate an urgent response to the climate crisis.\\n\\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the “non-negotiable” price of entry to the summit for leaders from governments, business, cities and regions, civil society and finance, will be “new, credible climate action to accelerate the pace of change.”\\n\\n“No exceptions. No compromises,” he told a year-end news conference. “There will be no room for back-sliders, green-washers, blame-shifters or repackaging of announcements of previous years.”\\n\\nGuterres said the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) “is gasping for breath” and “will soon disappear” as the gap between actual greenhouse gas emissions and the amount allowing the target to be met keeps growing.\\n\\nHe said the summit will take place alongside “a crucial gathering of world leaders” during their annual September gathering at the U.N. General Assembly to discuss lagging efforts to meet the 17 U.N. goals with 169 specific targets to eradicate global poverty and hunger, achieve gender equality, improve living standards and take urgent action to combat climate change, all by 2030.\\n\\nGuterres said it will be “very similar probably” to the first Climate Action Summit that he convened in September 2019 where only those with “concrete proposals” were invited.\\n\\nAt that meeting, after an emotional appeal from then 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, leaders from 66 countries promised more ambitious climate goals to prevent a warming world from reaching even more dangerous levels and 30 swore to be carbon neutral by midcentury. But the leaders and outside experts said it wasn’t enough to stop global warming.\\n\\nGuterres blamed governments for this failure, saying “national climate plans are falling woefully short,” though he acknowledged some steps have been taken to shift the global economy away from the fossil fuel use that is largely to blame for heating up the planet.\\n\\nThe U.N. chief said he will keep pushing for what he called “a Global Solidarity Pact, in which all big emitters make an extra effort to reduce emissions this decade in line with the 1.5-degree goal and ensure support for those who need it.”\\n\\n“I have pulled no punches on the imperative for all of us to confront this existential threat,” Guterres said. “And I will not relent.”\\n\\n___\\n\\nJordans reported from Berlin.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Paul Ellis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\\n\\nBefore it started, the United Nations global climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26 was billed by its chief organizer as the “last, best hope” to save the planet.\\n\\nHalfway through, optimistic reviews of its progress noted that heads of state and titans of industry showed up in force to start the gathering with splashy new climate promises, a sign that momentum was building in the right direction.\\n\\nThe pessimistic outlook? Gauzy promises mean little without concrete plans to follow through. The Swedish activist Greta Thunberg accused the conference of consisting of a lot of “blah, blah, blah.”\\n\\nOn Saturday, diplomats from nearly 200 countries struck a major agreement aimed at intensifying efforts to fight climate change, by calling on governments to return next year with stronger plans to curb their planet-warming emissions and urging wealthy nations to “at least double” funding by 2025 to protect the most vulnerable nations from the hazards of a hotter planet.\\n\\nHere’s a look at some key takeaways from the 26th annual United Nations climate change summit.\\n\\nTime for action is running out\\n\\nThe agreement established a clear consensus that all nations need to do much more, immediately, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.\\n\\nWhen the conference opened the U.N. Secretary General, António Guterres, said the top priority must be to limit the rise in global temperatures to just 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. That’s the threshold, scientists have warned, beyond which the risk of calamities like deadly heat waves, water shortages and ecosystem collapse grows immensely. (The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.)\\n\\n“The reality is you’ve got two different truths going on,” Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said last week. “We’ve made much more progress than we ever could’ve imagined a couple years ago. But it’s still nowhere near enough.”\\n\\nThe agreement outlines specific steps the world should take, from slashing global carbon dioxide emissions nearly in half by 2030 to curbing emissions of methane, another potent greenhouse gas. And it sets up new rules to hold countries accountable for the progress they make — or fail to make.\\n\\nThe environment minister of the Maldives, Shauna Aminath, said the latest text lacked the “urgency” that vulnerable countries like hers required. “What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time,” she said.\\n\\nWho needs to cut and how much?\\n\\nThe final agreement leaves unresolved the crucial question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its emissions over the next decade.\\n\\nRich countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and much of western Europe, account for just 12 percent of the global population today but are responsible for 50 percent of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years.\\n\\nPresident Biden and European leaders have insisted that countries like India, Indonesia and South Africa need to accelerate their shift away from coal power and other fossil fuels. But those countries counter that they lack the financial resources to do so, and that rich countries have been stingy with aid.\\n\\nA decade ago, the world’s wealthiest economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer countries by 2020. But they have fallen short by tens of billions of dollars annually. The COP26 agreement still leaves many developing countries without the funds they need to build cleaner energy and cope with increasingly extreme weather disasters.\\n\\nThe call for disaster aid and regulation increases\\n\\nOne of the biggest fights at the summit in Glasgow revolved around whether — and how — the world’s wealthiest nations, which are disproportionately responsible for global warming to date, should compensate poorer nations for the damages caused by rising temperatures.\\n\\nCalls for this fund, an issue called “loss and damage,” is separate from money to help poorer countries adapt to a changing climate. Loss and damage is a matter of historic responsibility, its proponents say, and would pay for irreparable losses, such as the disappearance of national territory, culture and ecosystems.\\n\\nThe Paris agreement in 2015 urged clearer rules on how to allow polluting companies and countries to buy and trade permits to lower global emissions, but the extremely dense and technical subject continued as a topic of discussion well into Saturday in Glasgow.\\n\\nNegotiators announced a major deal on how to regulate the fast-growing global market in carbon offsets, in which one company or country compensates for its own emissions by paying someone else to reduce theirs. One of the thorniest technical issues is how to properly account for these global trades so that any reductions in emissions aren’t overestimated or double-counted.\\n\\nVulnerable countries insist that rich nations should grant them a share of proceeds from carbon market transactions to help them build resilience to climate change. The United States and the European Union have opposed doing so, but island nations in particular want a mechanism to ensure that carbon trading leads to an overall reduction in global emissions.\\n\\n“We want a credible market that will deliver reductions in emissions, not just a free pass for countries to buy cheap credits offshore to meet their national requirements,” said Ian Fry, a negotiator for the Solomon Islands, an archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nOther international agreements came out of the summit\\n\\nU.S. and China : The two countries announced a joint agreement to do more to cut emissions this decade, and China committed for the first time to develop a plan to reduce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The pact between the rivals, which are the world’s two biggest polluters, surprised delegates to the summit. The agreement was short on specifics and while China agreed to “phase down” coal starting in 2026, it did not specify by how much or over what period of time.\\n\\nDeforestation : Leaders of more than 100 countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and the United States, vowed to end deforestation by 2030. The agreement covers about 85 percent of the world’s forests, which are crucial to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing the pace of global warming. Some advocacy groups criticized the agreement as lacking teeth, noting that similar efforts have failed in the past.\\n\\nMethane : More than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas, 30 percent by the end of this decade. The pledge was part of a push by the Biden administration, which also announced that the Environmental Protection Agency would limit the methane coming from about one million oil and gas rigs across the United States.\\n\\nIndia: India joined the growing chorus of nations pledging to reach “net zero” emissions, setting a 2070 deadline to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. One of the world’s largest consumers of coal, India also said that it would significantly expand the portion of its total energy mix that comes from renewable sources, and that half of its energy would come from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030.\\n\\nThe different faces of climate action\\n\\nThere was a clear gender and generation gap at the Glasgow talks. Those with the power to make decisions about how much the world warms in the coming decades are mostly old and male. Those who are angriest about the pace of climate action are mostly young and female.\\n\\nMalik Amin Aslam, an adviser to the prime minister of Pakistan, scoffed at some of the distant net zero goals being announced during the conference, including India’s: “With an average age of 60, I don’t think anyone in the negotiating room would live to experience that net zero in 2070,” he said.\\n\\nOn the first day of the conference, Greta Thunberg joined scores of protesters on the streets outside the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow. Throughout the two-week conference she and other young climate activists — including Vanessa Nakate, Dominika Lasota and Mitzi Tan — made numerous appearances at protests.\\n\\nMs. Thunberg told the BBC in an interview ahead of the summit that she had not been officially invited to speak. She added that she thought the organizers had not invited a lot of young speakers because they “might be scared that if they invite too many ‘radical’ young people then that might make them look bad,” she said, using air quotations.\\n\\nJust holding the talks during the pandemic posed a challenge\\n\\nThe climate summit, which was delayed last year, is one of the biggest international gatherings held during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nMany summit participants traveled from countries where vaccines are still not widely available. Globally, fewer than half of all adults have been vaccinated against Covid-19, illustrating the inequities of vaccination. Travel and quarantine restrictions meant additional costs in both time and money for lodging, which made the trip impossible for some.\\n\\nAnd some participants, like President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, decided against traveling at all.\\n\\nPartway through, conference organizers issued a letter of apology to participants for the long lines and video difficulties, saying that planning around Covid restrictions has been challenging. Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the U.N. climate body, asked attendees to “bear with us” as organizers grappled with the complex arrangements, like ensuring that all those entering the venue tested negative for the coronavirus, and enforcing controls on the number of people in meeting rooms.'], similarity=0.4573930421223243)]),\n",

This is attributed to their basic units, called qubits, which can exist in any combination of states, unlike classical bits constrained to a definite value of 1 or 0. Due to this infinite variety of qubit states, a quantum computer should be able to easily handle computational problems that would take a conventional computer trillions of years to solve.\\n\\nScientists have successfully created qubits from particles such as photons, atoms, individual electrons, or even a superconducting loop. However, creating a qubit is one thing, building a working quantum computer out of thousands or even millions of qubits is an entirely different challenge, and attempts thus far have been fraught with substantial difficulties.\\n\\nFor a quantum computer to work, it is necessary to establish and manipulate subtle quantum interactions among multiple qubits — a state known as entanglement. However, for this to work, the qubits themselves need to remain stable or “coherent”, which means keeping it in a well-defined quantum state. The problem is, coherence is difficult to maintain as it easily crumbles when qubits interact with their surroundings — even radiation from space can throw them.\\n\\nTo solve this, a team of Japanese researchers led by Nobuhiro Yanai, associate professor at Kyushu University, has engineered a stable qubit using a special structure called a metal-organic framework. This structure involves combining pentacene molecules (made up of five connected benzene rings) with zirconium ions and organic dicarboxylate ligands. The pentacene molecules act like bridges, linking the ligands and ions together into a framework made up of both organic molecules and metal ions–hence the name.\\n\\nThe role of the qubit was played by a pair of neighboring pentacene molecules, which were coupled and exist within five different quantum states achieved by irradiating the metal-organic framework with various wavelengths of microwave radiation.\\n\\nThe metal-organic framework’s nanoscale voids offer the pentacene molecules a degree of freedom, but ultimately restricts their full movement under the radiation’s influence, ensuring they formed a desired quantum state and remained trapped in it for a significant amount of time.\\n\\n“The metal-organic framework in this work is a unique system that can densely accumulate [pentacene molecules],” said Yanai in a press release. “Additionally, the nanopores inside the crystal enable [them] to rotate, but at a very restrained angle.”\\n\\nThe most important result of the study was that the team could maintain coherence for more than a hundred nanoseconds at room temperature, whereas previously this could only be achieved in similar systems at incredibly cold temperatures of about -200 degrees Celsius. At such temperatures, it was possible to maintain coherence only in photonic qubits, but in addition to needing such extreme conditions to operate, quantum computers using these photon qubits suffer from photon leakage.\\n\\nMaintaining cryogenic temperatures is not only expensive but complicates the entire computing setup. Thus, creating a stable qubit that operates at room temperature is an impressive and practical achievement.\\n\\nLooking ahead, the scientists are optimistic about extending coherence for even longer periods. They believe that by designing improved metal-organic frameworks and identifying more suitable molecules for qubits, they can push the boundaries further.\\n\\n“It will be possible to generate quintet […] state qubits more efficiently in the future by searching for guest molecules that can induce more such suppressed motions and by developing suitable metal-organic framework structures,” concluded Yanai. “This can open doors to room-temperature molecular quantum computing.”\\n\\nReference: Akio Yamauchi et al, Room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a metal-organic framework, Science Advances (2024), DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adi3147\\n\\nFeature image credit: geralt on Pixabay'], similarity=0.6476427316665649), Origin(name='Bing', url=['https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-and-quantinuum-have-teamed-up-in-the-race-for-quantum-supremacy/articleshow/109103007.cms', 'https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2024/04/12/data-privacy--secure-access-to-quantum-computing-from-home-now-p.html', 'https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/breakthrough-in-quantum-computing-microsoft-and-quantinuum-make-strides/ar-BB1l2Urk'], data=[\"Microsoft and Quantinuum Crack the Code (Partially)\\n\\nThe Road to Quantum Supremacy\\n\\nQuantum computing hopefuls, Microsoft and Quantinuum , have announced a significant breakthrough in creating reliable quantum computers. This advancement brings the dream of commercially viable quantum computing a step closer.The race to develop functional quantum computers is intensifying. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google (through Alphabet), and IBM are battling each other and even nation-states to harness the power of quantum mechanics.These machines promise processing speeds far exceeding traditional silicon-based computers, potentially enabling scientific breakthroughs that would take millions of years on current technology.The core building block of a quantum computer, the qubit, is both powerful and sensitive. While it offers incredible processing potential, even minor disturbances can cause data errors. To overcome this hurdle, researchers often use more physical qubits than needed and then employ error-correction techniques to create a smaller number of reliable, functional qubits.Microsoft and Quantinuum claim to have cracked the error-correction code to some extent. By applying Microsoft's error-correction algorithm to Quantinuum's physical qubits, they were able to generate four reliable qubits from a pool of 30 physical ones. According to Microsoft's Jason Zander, this represents the best ratio of functional qubits to physical qubits ever achieved.Their efforts yielded impressive results. The system successfully ran over 14,000 experiments without a single error, boasting an 800x improvement over previous records. Microsoft plans to integrate this technology into its cloud computing platform within the coming months.While the ideal number of reliable qubits needed to outperform classical supercomputers is estimated to be around 100, neither company offered a timeframe for achieving this milestone using their new technique. However, Ilyas Khan, Quantinuum's chief product officer, expressed optimism, suggesting this breakthrough could shave at least two years off the previous timeline.This development marks a significant leap towards practical quantum computing, paving the way for a future where these powerful machines can revolutionize scientific research and problem-solving across various fields.\", 'Scientists at Oxford University Physics have achieved a major breakthrough in quantum computing, ensuring unprecedented security and privacy for individuals and companies. This advancement is poised to revolutionize cloud-based quantum computing, potentially opening the doors to millions for harnessing its full power.\\n\\nQuantum computing, with its potential to transform services across various sectors such as healthcare and financial services, operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional computing, offering significantly enhanced capabilities. However, concerns regarding the stability of quantum computing in controlled conditions and the effectiveness of current security and encryption systems have been a hurdle to its widespread adoption.\\n\\nLeading providers of cloud-based services, including Google, Amazon, and IBM, have been offering quantum computing elements separately. Yet, ensuring the security and privacy of customer data has been a critical prerequisite for scaling up its use and enabling the development of new applications. The recent study by Oxford University Physics researchers addresses these critical challenges.\\n\\nProfessor David Lucas, co-head of the Oxford University Physics research team and lead scientist at the UK Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub, expressed the significance of their achievement, stating, \"We have shown for the first time that quantum computing in the cloud can be accessed in a scalable, practical way which will also give people complete security and privacy of data, plus the ability to verify its authenticity.\"\\n\\nThe researchers\\' approach, known as \"blind quantum computing,\" establishes a secure connection between two distinct quantum computing entities, potentially allowing individuals at home or in an office to access a cloud server in a completely secure manner. Importantly, their innovative methods hold the potential to be scaled up for large-scale quantum computations.\\n\\nDr. Peter Drmota, the lead researcher of the study, highlighted the implications of their work, stating, \"Using blind quantum computing, clients can access remote quantum computers to process confidential data with secret algorithms and even verify the results are correct, without revealing any useful information. Realizing this concept is a big step forward in both quantum computing and keeping our information safe online.\"\\n\\nThe system devised by the researchers involves a fiber network link between a quantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, enabling blind quantum computing over a network. The researchers utilized a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this, ensuring real-time compliance with the algorithm for every computation.\\n\\nProfessor David Lucas emphasized the urgency of addressing privacy and security concerns in the era of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, stating, \"As quantum computers become more capable, people will seek to use them with complete security and privacy over networks, and our new results mark a step change in capability in this respect.\"', ''], similarity=0.42310677468776703)]),\n",

When I first started writing about the public’s hostility toward expertise and established knowledge more than a decade ago, I predicted that any number of crises—including a pandemic—might be the moment that snaps the public back to its senses. I was wrong. I didn’t foresee how some citizens and their leaders would respond to the cycle of advances and setbacks in the scientific process and to the inevitable limitations of human experts.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic, in particular, would prove the perfect crucible for accelerating the decline of faith in experts. Paranoia and appeals to ignorance have long been part of the American political environment, but they were especially destructive at a time when the U.S. was riven by partisan hostility. The pandemic struck at multiple political and cultural weaknesses within the edifice of American life: A mysterious disease—from China, no less, a nation that typically serves as a source of American anxiety—forced citizens to rely on the media, including outlets that many of them already distrusted, for scattered pieces of information from white-jacketed experts and relatively unknown government officials.\\n\\nMany elected leaders, especially at the national level, failed, in fact, to lead. The dysfunction of President Donald Trump’s administration, on COVID-19 and on so many other issues, has been amply documented in numerous books and articles. Despite the undeniable success of Operation Warp Speed, the government’s crash program to work with private industry to develop a vaccine in record time, Trump and his people have much to answer for—including the hesitancy they engendered among Americans to take the very vaccines that his administration helped develop.\\n\\nThe road to America’s pandemic meltdown, however, did not begin with Trump. When the coronavirus arrived, a significant number of Americans were already primed by the media, their political leaders, and their own stubborn narcissism to reject expert advice during a crisis. The collapse of gatekeeping authority in the media, the explosion of worthless online sources, the emergence of celebrity pseudo-experts, and the unwarranted self-confidence of millions of people who believed that they could simply “do their own research,” as the internet mantra has it, all combined to make a brutal outbreak of disease even more deadly.\\n\\nRead: The coronavirus-denial movement now has a leader\\n\\nNevertheless, where the death of expertise is concerned, the scientific community and its allies in the public-policy arena made two fundamental mistakes early on. One is that they tried to take the place of elected officials: They issued guidance and policy instructions while trying to fill the vacuum left by poor leadership in Washington, D.C., and other regions of the United States. And at the height of the lockdowns, doctors and local authorities in some cities made a nakedly political calculation about whether and when their ostensibly firm pandemic restrictions could be ignored.\\n\\nMasks and lockdowns were among the most divisive pandemic measures. As usual, Trump was resolutely ignorant and self-centered. He and his movement coalesced around depicting such public-health measures as symbols of government autocracy. At a July 2020 White House meeting, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, advised him to advocate for mask mandates, which at that point even most Republicans supported. Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, objected. “We can’t do the masks,” he told the president. “The base will just turn on you.” Trump sided with Meadows.\\n\\nBut many of Trump’s opponents themselves adopted a blinkered insistence on such mandates as their own version of political signaling. In an already polarized environment, each side hoisted their flags and charged into battle—with scant regard for evidence or expert advice.\\n\\nThe scientists unwisely stepped into this mess, with predictable results. The American public has little tolerance for nuance or complexity, and the recommendations on mask wearing were difficult to parse and changed over time. What kind of mask would work best? (An N-95 respirator—if worn correctly.) Would cloth masks work? Bandannas, maybe? (Probably not very well.) Should masks be worn everywhere? Indoors, outdoors—even at home?\\n\\nThe public wanted clear and unambiguous answers that the scientists could not give them: yes or no, safe or unsafe, on or off. Woefully unaccustomed to explaining complicated issues to ordinary citizens, they made a hash of the messaging and simply tried to push for masks as a generic measure, until many Americans—even those who wanted to be cooperative—gave up.\\n\\nAdvocates for lockdowns and strict masking rules argued that they had the stronger point in a time of uncertainty. Such prophylactic measures, they contended, even if ragged and inconsistent, were better than flatly ignoring manifest public-health dangers. But “following the science” means following all of the science, and these rigid, dogmatic responses downplayed the fact that the science was also showing that some COVID-19 policies did, in fact, carry a destructive price. The lockdowns, as the COVID Crisis Group (a nonpartisan collection of scholars and scientists) noted later, were not a solution but a “sledgehammer” that took the place of better preparation and resulted from an inability to agree on almost anything else.\\n\\nThe subsequent extended closure of public spaces in the U.S. produced deep social and economic wounds, but the controversy over when to reopen schools was a particularly important area of expert failure. The closures of educational institutions went on too long in many parts of the country, resulting in emotional and intellectual damage to American students.\\n\\nRead: Paging Dr. Hamblin: Why didn’t America’s shutdowns work?\\n\\nMany progressives, however, bitterly contested growing evidence both that in-person schooling was relatively safe and that school closures had created catastrophic learning loss. This was in many cases a stubborn reaction, a kind of polar opposition to the obdurate people on the right who dismissed almost all pandemic measures as oppression. For the left, as the New York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait later noted, “the evidence did eventually win out,” while the Republicans descended into an “epistemic disaster” that persists to this day.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the evidence did not win out in time to prevent harm, especially in schools. Public-school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom, but many teachers were hesitant, and one of their largest unions, the American Federation of Teachers, and its leader, Randi Weingarten, were resistant to the point of militancy. Weingarten warned in July 2020 that the AFT might even support strikes if teachers were forced back to the classroom.\\n\\nThe pressure from the AFT had a clear effect on national policy subsequently. Within weeks of taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden backpedaled on his campaign promises to open schools. According to my Atlantic colleague Franklin Foer, Biden acquiesced to writing off the rest of the academic year as “the price of peace” with the union.\\n\\nThe teachers’ concerns were understandable, but the intransigence of some of their union leaders did significant harm to their already battered standing. Meanwhile, over those same months, another expert community—this time, medical professionals—needlessly inflicted a grievous wound on the impartiality of their own expertise.\\n\\nOn May 25, 2020, a white police officer murdered a Black man named George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis. The incident was captured on video and protests soon broke out all over America.\\n\\nDoctors and scientists had a problem on their hands. Floyd’s killing produced an outpouring of grief and anger: Americans wanted to gather, they wanted to support one another, they wanted to vent their fury, and they wanted to shout their demands for justice into the face of their government. And yet because of COVID-19 restrictions, most Americans could not congregate in public. They could not go to church or sing in a choir. They could not celebrate their marriages, bury their dead, or even, in some areas, meet outdoors for a picnic. Schoolchildren were still trapped in their homes.\\n\\nAmerica’s cities were beginning to boil, and public-safety officials faced a no-win situation: If states and localities tried to suppress the demonstrations, their directions would be ignored. But if they allowed the protests, they were admitting that the pandemic restrictions were capricious rules that could bend in the political wind. How could one cause be important enough to allow thousands upon thousands of people to gather in close proximity, while all other citizens were told that their rights—including their freedom to worship and to engage in peaceful assembly—were secondary to the needs of public health and that they must stay home?\\n\\nRead: Facing a COVID-19 resurgence and unable to act\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci was at the time the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the U.S. government’s main public-health spokespeople. He would later enter right-wing demonology caricatured as a leftist authoritarian, but in June 2020 he gave one of the most diplomatic and sensible answers to be found among the scientists:\\n\\nIt’s a difficult situation. We have the right to peacefully demonstrate and the demonstrators are exercising that right … It’s a delicate balance because the reasons for demonstrating are valid and yet the demonstration itself puts oneself at an additional risk. The only thing we can do as public-health officials is to keep warning people to be careful. And if you are going to go out, please make sure you wear a mask and you keep the mask on at all times.\\n\\nOther doctors, however, were eager to show solidarity with the protests. In June 2020, more than 1,200 medical professionals signed an open letter supporting the demonstrations, casting Floyd’s death as a health menace on the same level as the pandemic. “Infectious disease and public health narratives adjacent to demonstrations against racism must be consciously anti-racist, and infectious disease experts must be clear and consistent in prioritizing an anti-racist message,” they wrote. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.”\\n\\nNoble if stilted rhetoric, but even people who empathized with the protesters had to notice that the previous strict prohibitions on gathering were now, for the sake of an important political cause, apparently negotiable. According to The Washington Post, Ranu S. Dhillon, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard Medical School, characterized the protests as risky but necessary—just like working in a nursing home or grocery store, an approach that showed how out of touch many professionals were with ordinary people who were afraid to visit elderly relatives or go to the market.\\n\\nThe available evidence does not so far suggest that the protests created a major surge in COVID-19 infections. But to argue that the sudden reversal in public-health advice did not result in more infections is a post hoc rationalization—and, for experts, a trap.\\n\\nAt the time, the medical guidance was clear that people should not gather in large groups or be in proximity, and certainly not while singing and shouting. If doctors believed that the risks of such gatherings could be mitigated with masks or by being outdoors, they should have already been pressing for the lifting of the strictest measures everywhere, with the same advice they gave protesters. But if they were still holding to the theories that underpinned the lockdowns—and especially the school closures—then their approval of the demonstrations meant they were consciously setting aside those concerns in the name of a political cause with which they agreed.\\n\\nEither way, they were acting as advocates rather than scientists. In the words of the environmental journalist Peter M. Sandman, they “clearly damaged the credibility of public health as a scientific enterprise that struggles to be politically neutral.”\\n\\nThe global pandemic emergency is formally over, and the experts are still assessing what they did right and wrong—as they should. But in the U.S., the political damage from the coronavirus wars remains. The most intrusive measures, including lockdowns and masking, are long gone. For most Americans, especially the elderly and other vulnerable groups, avoiding the most serious consequences of COVID-19 has become chiefly a matter of getting vaccinated and staying current on booster shots, as they would with flu and pneumonia.\\n\\nAnd yet, the U.S. still lags the rest of the developed world in protection against COVID-19. According to the CDC’s most up-to-date data, from 2023, some 70 percent of Americans received an initial vaccination, but fewer than 20 percent have had any booster. The rates are much better among people over 65, who—for various reasons, including their awareness of the disease’s increased danger for their age group—are more attentive to getting vaccinated.\\n\\nThe ultimate numbers, however, obscure the deep political divisions over vaccination, preventive measures, and science itself. A New York Times/Siena poll in 2023 found that nearly 70 percent of likely Republican voters would trust “the common sense of ordinary people” over “the knowledge of trained experts.” (In a Pew poll a year earlier, 51 percent of Americans said that public-health officials had done an excellent or good job at managing the pandemic, but that number was anchored by the 72 percent of Democrats who felt that way; only 29 percent of Republicans agreed.)\\n\\nTrump, of course, has continued his crude deployment of ignorance and fear in his second bid to regain the American presidency. When new variants of the virus began to spread in the summer of 2023, Trump released a video decrying the “tyrants” who were going to impose new pandemic mandates. “We will not comply,” he said, defying measures that did not actually exist. Fortunately, most people in the United States now have some level of immunity, and governments at all levels have learned a great deal about monitoring and treating the disease.\\n\\nNonetheless, as the COVID Crisis Group noted in 2023, “one key predictor of infections and total COVID deaths” in each state during the pandemic “was the share of people that voted for President Trump in the 2020 presidential election.” Or, as a member of the group remarked in an overview of the pandemic’s course and the American lives lost, “Trump was a comorbidity.”\\n\\nJay Varma: The public-health calculus has shifted\\n\\nThe experts failed at some important points, especially in the early days of the pandemic, but much of what the public believed to be failure was better described as science—the way that knowledge itself is developed as experts worked through a new problem with limited data. They argued and tested competing explanations and solutions. Such debates and discussions, along with the inevitable costs of trial and error during a time of emergency, are the normal processes of scientific investigation. But America’s political environment in 2020, poisoned by ignorance and rigid tribalism, virtually guaranteed that almost all aspects of the pandemic response—both failures and successes—would become divisive and partisan issues.\\n\\nExperts are fallible human beings, and they will sometimes give poor advice or make mistakes. But an advanced society and its government cannot do without them, no matter what a significant number of Americans seem to believe. To ignore expert advice is simply not a realistic option: Policy making is complex, and citizens have some responsibility to stay informed about issues that directly affect their own well-being. Experts always need to remember that they are the servants, not the masters, of a democratic society and a republican government. But as James Madison presciently warned, if citizens are to be the authors of their own fate, they must first equip themselves with knowledge, and then practice the civic virtue based on reason and cooperation that makes an informed democracy possible.\\n\\nBefore the next crisis—and there will always be another—citizens, experts, and policy makers have to engage in a difficult debate about the role of experts and educated elites in American democracy. For now, such possibilities have been thwarted by the partisan combat that erupted after the coronavirus pandemic. I still have confidence that we can, at some point, embrace the reality-based understandings we once accepted as obvious: Chief among them is that although every single vote in a democracy is as equally valid as every other, every single opinion is not.\\n\\nAmerica needs to reestablish new rules for productive engagement between the educated elites and the society they serve. But after the political events and natural disasters of the past decade, the creation of a more productive relationship between the experts and the public is going to be a challenge, and it will require time. The sooner the better, because the clock, as always, is counting down to the next unknown disaster.\\n\\nThis essay is adapted from a new edition of the author’s book The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters .', 'Plastic pollution may have met its match: The saliva of wax worms NBC\\n\\nThiel, Bezos and Zuckerberg join parade of insiders selling tech stocks FT\\n\\nClimate\\n\\n#COVID19\\n\\nThousands of disabled people died after ‘Covid treatment withheld’, inquiry to probe iNews.

Unfortunately, this change was not well recognized by the public and as many as 58% answered they were not aware of the relaxed policy in a November 2022 survey . The television news, and newspapers at that time [i.e., official propaganda] were welcoming life without masks again, especially when the notoriously hot and humid summer season in Japan was approaching. The subsequent 7th surge, however, was the most severe surge since the pandemic was declared and Japan had the world’s worst record for 10 consecutive weeks during July and September 2022 according to the WHO report [11]. This surge frightened people [My goodness me, why?] and they voluntarily continued to practice masking, though the government mask-wearing policy was left relaxed during the 7th surge.\\n\\nAnd letting the cat out of the bag:\\n\\nOther than the 7th surge, extreme mask affinity which could be referred [indeed it could, but by whom?} to as “mask dependence” developed after 3 years of daily masking practice is also a contributing factor.\\n\\n“Seatbelt dependence,” “water treatment dependence”, “manual safety dependence,” “traffic light dependence”….\\n\\nAwaiting a decision on new research regulations, scientists pen dueling articles to shape ‘gain-of-function’ policies Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

Unfortunately, many elected leaders and public health officials have held on far too long to the hypothesis that natural immunity offers unreliable protection against covid-19 — a contention that is being rapidly debunked by science.\\n\\nThese three sentences have an interesting relationship, don’t they?\\n\\nWe’ll Have Herd Immunity by April\\n\\nI’ll return to them in a bit, but first let’s flashback to February 2021. 450,000 Americans died of COVID in in the pandemic’s first year, overwhelming hospitals and morgues. The worst wave, where over 3,000 Americans died per day, was just receding. The virus was just 1 year-old, and it had given us plenty of reasons to respect it so far.\\n\\nNot everyone felt that way.\\n\\nOn February 18th, Dr. Markary authored an article titled We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April. He was very confident about this new virus. “Experts should level with the public about the good news,” he said. He said:\\n\\nSome medical experts privately agreed with my prediction that there may be very little Covid-19 by April but suggested that I not to talk publicly about herd immunity because people might become complacent and fail to take precautions or might decline the vaccine. But scientists shouldn’t try to manipulate the public by hiding the truth…Herd immunity is the inevitable result of viral spread and vaccination. When the chain of virus transmission has been broken in multiple places, it’s harder for it to spread—and that includes the new strains.\\n\\nThen in March, he authored an article titled Herd Immunity Is Near, Despite Fauci’s Denial. He said:\\n\\nAnthony Fauci has been saying that the country needs to vaccinate 70% to 85% of the population to reach herd immunity from Covid-19. But he inexplicably ignores natural immunity. If you account for previous infections, herd immunity is likely close at hand.\\n\\nIn May, Dr. Makary continued his media blitz to announce big news. He had been right. Herd immunity had arrived, and it was time to “stop living in fear”. In an article titled Don’t Buy The Fearmongering: The COVID-19 Threat Is Waning he said “On a clinical level, we simply have not seen significant re-infections at any concerning rate.” “The public-health threat is now defanged”, he added.\\n\\nIn another article titled Risk Of COVID Is Now Very Low — It’s Time To Stop Living In Fear: Doctor he said:\\n\\nCOVID cases are collapsing in front of our eyes…Yet some people want the pandemic to stretch out longer\\n\\nDuring an interview on Fox New that month, he dismissed the concerns about variants and said the main priority was to not “scare people”. “People need something to look forward to,” he said. He also had this exchange:\\n\\nQuestion: You talked about this a couple of months ago. You said look, we are two months away from herd immunity. Are we there, are we closer, is it ever going to be full realized in your estimation? Answer: Well unfortunately, we have this perception now that’s being created by some public health leaders that we reach to total eradication. And we’re not going to get to total risk elimination. That is a false goal and quite honestly it’s being used to manipulate the public. We heard today if get to 70% vaccination, then we can see restrictions. That’s dishonest. Most of the country is at herd immunity. Other parts will get there later this month… I call that herd immunity.\\n\\nI don’t remember anyone serious talking about “total risk elimination” in May 2021, though through this straw man argument, Dr. Makary sought to convince his audience that “public health leaders” were dishonest manipulators out to scare people. In contrast, he was a straight shooter, willing to tell bravely the truth- most of the country is at herd immunity.\\n\\nIn June, Dr. Makary formalized his thoughts in an article called The Power of Natural Immunity, another article that paid homage to the “power” of being infected with a potentially deadly virus. He said:\\n\\nThe news about the U.S. Covid pandemic is even better than you’ve heard… There’s ample scientific evidence that natural immunity is effective and durable, and public-health leaders should pay it heed.\\n\\nHe added:\\n\\nWith more than 8 in 10 adults protected from either contracting or transmitting the virus, it can’t readily propagate by jumping around in the population. In public health, we call that herd immunity, defined broadly on the Johns Hopkins Covid information webpage as “when most of a population is immune.” It’s not eradication, but it’s powerful.\\n\\nDr. Makary concluded:\\n\\nIt’s time to stop the fear mongering and level with the public.\\n\\nSo far this year, nearly 2.8 million cases of COVID have been reported in the U.S.\\n\\nLet’s return to those three sentences from Dr. Makary’s article Natural Immunity to Covid Is Powerful. Policymakers Seem Afraid to Say So:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt. Unfortunately, many elected leaders and public health officials have held on far too long to the hypothesis that natural immunity offers unreliable protection against covid-19 — a contention that is being rapidly debunked by science.\\n\\nWe all know what happened next.\\n\\nSince February 2021, when Dr. Makary penned We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April, around 700,000 Americans have died of COVID and millions more have been injured by it. It’s not over yet. Unfortunately, those “elected leaders and public health officials” turned out to be right. Natural immunity offers unreliable protection against COVID, and reinfections are hardly rare events. Despite the abundance and “power” of natural immunity, we still do not have herd immunity.\\n\\nDelta is downgraded to a mild seasonal virus that causes mild common cold-like symptoms.\\n\\nSo, did Dr. Makary adapt when new data proved his scientific hypothesis was incorrect? Not that I’ve seen. I have not seen him acknowledge his bizarre fetishization of the “power of natural immunity” was misplaced. I have not seen him revisit his doomed declarations of herd immunity. I have not seen him retract his unprofessional slurs that “public health leaders” were “dishonest” and trying to “manipulate the public” because they wanted the pandemic to continue.\\n\\nHe’s not alone.\\n\\nMany doctors sounded exactly like Dr. Makary in 2021. These “free-thinking” doctors also claimed that natural immunity was a “triumph,” that vaccines were a panacea for those who needed them, that variants were nothing to “panic” about, and that kid’s didn’t need the COVID vaccine because the pandemic was ending. They too disparaged anyone who disagreed as having an “addiction to doom and gloom.”\\n\\nYet, when the pandemic failed to end, these doctors just barreled on full-steam ahead as if none of that ever happened. Their confident, optimistic proclamations- most of the country is at herd immunity– were made and then instantly forgotten, without a moment’s recognition of error or the slightest expression of regret to those they smeared as “fear mongers.”\\n\\nIn fact, doctors who said the pandemic was winding down in the first half of 2021, devoted the second half of that year not to pausing their COVID commentary and reflecting on their failed forecasts, but rather by doubling down and minimizing the variants that obliterated their pollyannaish predictions. No matter what was happening on the ground, they just kept robotically repeating the exact same things they’d always said. There was always “reassuring data“. It was always time to stop “living in fear“. They were all completely predictable.\\n\\nArticles from February, July, and December 2021\\n\\nLike these doctors, Dr. Makary also failed to adapt to new data when the Delta variant arrived, wrecking his declarations of herd immunity. As it ripped through much the country, he just kept robotically repeating the exact same things he’d always said. He gave in interview in June titled Dr. Marty Makary Pans ‘Fear-Mongering’ Over Delta Variant, and in August he said:\\n\\nIf you’re one of the 99%+ of kids that are unvaccinated…those kids don’t need to worry…For most people right now, Delta is downgraded to a mild seasonal virus that causes mild common cold-like symptoms…The vaccines have been perfectly consistent against all of the variants.\\n\\nOf course, Dr. Makary and these other doctors were wrong about the Delta variant, which caused “record deaths” in many parts of the country and hit children harder than ever before, especially unvaccinated ones.\\n\\nPredictably, Dr. Makary also failed to adapt to new data when the Omicron variant arrived. As it ripped through much the country, he just kept robotically repeating the exact same things he’d always said. In December, he glorified the Omicron variant as “nature’s vaccine” and in an interview on Fox News titled Omicron Fear Fueling a ‘Second Pandemic of Lunacy’ said:\\n\\nWe’re seeing this massive new wave of fear that is fueling our second pandemic after COVID-19, which is a pandemic of lunacy, which is omicron. Now I call it omi-cold… This new scientific data from the lab explains the epidemiological data and the bedside observation of doctors that this is far more mild… and that’s why I call it omi-cold.\\n\\nOf course, Dr. Makary and these other doctors were wrong about the Omicron variant, as the articles During the Omicron Wave, Death Rates Soared for Older People and Hospitalizations Of Young Children With The Virus Surged During The U.S. Omicron Wave explain.\\n\\nAll that from the doctor who instructed others:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt.\\n\\nPublic health officials actively propagated misinformation that ruined lives and forever damaged public trust in the medical profession.\\n\\nMany people adapted to new data and relinquished their optimistic pandemic estimations when immune-evading variants arrived in the summer of 2021. These doctors did not. Minimizing COVID was a pure reflex for them. It was literally all they could do. What more could the virus have done to make them say, “OOPS! I was wrong to have said the pandemic was over“? The answer, of course, is “nothing.”\\n\\nTo my knowledge, just one of these doctors has ever acknowledged error for prematurely declaring the pandemic over. He’s also stopped doing this. Good for him. However, I can’t recall any doctor who said the pandemic ended in spring 2021 who later had the integrity to honestly reckon with the consequences of blasting out that false message in major media outlets for months on end. Million of Americans trusted these highly-credential doctors who spoke with great confidence when they said what we all wanted to hear.\\n\\nHow are these people doing today? Did all they all turn out OK?\\n\\nPredictably, instead of showing even a hint of concern about the fate of their audience and introspecting for a nanosecond, these doctors keep robotically repeating the exact same things they’ve always said. Despite his inglorious track record, Dr. Makary still fancies himself a brave truth-teller, entitled to sanctimoniously scold those dastardly “public health officials”. In an article from February 2023, ironically titled 10 Myths Told by COVID Experts — And Now Debunked, Dr. Makary spread blatant anti-vaccine falsities and continued to lavish praise on “natural immunity”. He also said this:\\n\\nPublic health officials actively propagated misinformation that ruined lives and forever damaged public trust in the medical profession.\\n\\nImagine the utter audacity, shamelessness, and lack of self-awareness it takes for the author of We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April to write that contemptible slur about people who were right about herd immunity 3-years ago. Nonetheless, I won’t disagree with him for saying:\\n\\nIt’s okay to have an incorrect scientific hypothesis. But when new data proves it wrong, you have to adapt.\\n\\nThat’s actually a really good idea.\\n\\nArticles from February, May, June, and December 2021\\n\\nShares'], similarity=0.29083233575026196), Origin(name='Google', url=['https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-need-to-panic-over-covid-surge-but-mask-up-say-doctors/articleshow/106193814.cms', 'https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/responding-to-the-new-covid-19-sub-variants-now-and-in-future/article67696277.ece', 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/covid-is-on-the-rise-as-who-alerts-virus-still-changing-evolving-as-jn-1-subvariant-cases-surges-11702865050415.html'], data=['Should everyone with symptoms be tested?\\n\\nIf testing is low, how can a surge be prevented?\\n\\nShould we wear a mask?\\n\\nIs it time for boosters yet?\\n\\nPrecautions to be taken by the government\\n\\nNearly 7 months after the WHO withdrew the public health emergency notification for Covid-19, the virus refuses to go away. The Omicron variant has mutated into several new subvariants, with the latest, JN.1, causing a surge in Covid cases. While experts said they will wait for a few more days before calling it a new wave and there’s no need to panic, they warn that the WHO-declared “variant of interest” may not be the last on the list.Seasonal flu like influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), respiratory infections caused by adenovirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus can cause monsoon-related ailments that mimic Covid-19 symptoms, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, former WHO chief scientist, said.“It is not possible to test everyone with symptoms. We must test people hospitalized with severe respiratory infection or pneumonia,” she said.One way to predict a surge is to look for microbes in wastewater. In several countries, wastewater sample are tested to detect and report on different infections circulating in a community, Dr Subramanian Swaminathan, an infectious diseases expert at Gleneagles Global Health City, said.“Wearing a mask in closed crowded spaces like wedding halls, trains and buses is a good idea. It can prevent several air-borne illnesses including Covid,” Dr K Kolandaisamy, former director of public health, says.“But there is no need to make masks mandatory yet. Elderly, pregnant women, and people with immune deficiencies must avoid going into crowded spaces. If they do, they must wear a mask. Those with respiratory infections, colds, and cough should also wear masks in crowded spaces,” he says.Vaccines have been working well in preventing severe disease. However, waning immunity is visible. People infected earlier and those vaccinated with at least 2 doses still get infected.JN.1 has been called a “variant of interest” by the WHO because of its transmissibility. In several countries, including India, updated versions of the vaccine are already available.“The elderly, people with comorbidities and chronic medical conditions are strongly recommended to take the vaccine,” Dr S Ramasubramanian, an infectious diseases expert at Apollo Hospitals, said.The directorate of public health advised all hospitals to keep equipment ready. Hospitals have been asked to do mock drills after checking on stock of medicines, and oxygen storage, Dr TS Selvavinayagam, director of public health, said.', 'January 02, 2024 12:59 am | Updated 12:31 pm IST\\n\\nIt is four years since the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later renamed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV2) was first reported on December 31, 2019 from China. In the months which followed, it caused severe COVID-19 waves in nearly every country, across the world. Alongside, at end December or early new year, there would be news of a new variant or sub-variant, or of a surge in cases in some countries. At the end of 2021, it was an Omicron variant (BA.1.1.529), and by the end 2022, the COVID-19 case surge in China made news. Now, a new subvariant of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the JN.1, is making news.\\n\\nVirus behaviour\\n\\nThe JN.1 sub-variant of Omicron has been reported from multiple countries and designated as a variant of interest (VoI) by the World Health Organization. This has raised some concerns and caused some worries. But is it really cause for concern? The short answer is a no. The reason is that the reporting of a new variant or sub-variant is on expected lines. In fact, in May 2023, while declaring the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO had highlighted the need for continuous tracking of the virus and its variants. The rationale was simple. The pandemic is over, but SARS-CoV-2 was and is circulating in all countries and all settings and will continue to do so for long, and possibly forever. That is how most viruses behave. Therefore, there is always the possibility of some seasonal changes in the number of cases, at unpredictable intervals. A linked feature is that the genetic material of the circulating viruses — especially of the respiratory virus — keeps changing over a period. These changes in genetic structure (genome) result in the designation of new variants and sub-variants.\\n\\nSince the reporting of the novel virus in 2019, more than 1,000 subvariants and recombinant sub-lineages have been reported. Against this backdrop, the emergence of JN.1 is not surprising. However, every change in genome does not matter, and the international agencies and subject experts are on task to assess the risk. However, if mutations or genetic changes result in an alternation in the characteristics of the virus (such as higher transmission, more severe disease or immune escape from vaccine induced or natural immunity), it merits greater attention. The variants are then termed as VoI or variants of concern (VoC). At present, there is no VoC in circulation in any part of the world. On March 16, 2023, WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution had downgraded the Omicron as the ‘previous’ variants of concern. However, national and global agencies are tracking the virus and JN.1 has been designated as VoI.\\n\\nJN.1 has been designated a VoI, which means it has some genetic changes and indicative characteristics in circulating viruses which need to be monitored by the health agencies and government. Such a designation is a call to step up genomic sequencing scientific work and use data to track the virus. JN.1 is not a new virus but a sub-variant of BA.2.86, which itself is a subvariant of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Till now, there is no evidence that JN.1 causes more severe disease or causes immune escape and is, thus, not a reason for worry. In short, designating a variant as VoI does not automatically mean there is a reason to worry. Till now, there is no evidence that JN.1 is responsible for severe disease or immune escape. In fact, the waste-water surveillance in some Indian cities had indicated that the new sub-variant has circulated to a majority of the population without major change in reported or clinical cases in the way of a ‘silent wave’.\\n\\nThe vaccine response\\n\\nDoes it mean we need to get additional shots of COVID-19 vaccines? Current scientific evidence supports that vaccines and natural infection continue to provide protection from any sub-variant, though there is some possibility of a decline in protection, as time has lapsed since the last vaccination. Immunologically, the natural infections which have happened in addition to vaccine shots, have provided hybrid immunity to people in India and many countries. Therefore, there is no immediate reason to worry. There is no scientific evidence to support having a fourth shot of COVID-19 vaccines, for any age group.\\n\\nWe also need to interpret the rise in COVID-19 cases more carefully. The spike in COVID-19 cases in India could be more artificial than real. It is likely that ramped up COVID-19 testing is picking more cases. Then, some deaths are being attributed to COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that those deaths are causally linked to SARS-CoV-2. These appear to be in the individuals who were already sick and had COVID-19, as an incidental finding. The average five or six deaths in a day in India also need to be considered in perspective.\\n\\nTo put this in context, every day in India, an estimated 27,000 people die due to a range of reasons that include old age. In contrast, respiratory diseases and tuberculosis kill 50 to 60 times more people every day than COVID-19 now. We need to shift attention to preventable deaths due to many other reasons.\\n\\nAct responsibly\\n\\nYet, four years should help us to learn. The government’s COVID-19 response and actions should be more nuanced and informed by all evidence and real time data. Citizens need to act responsibly and not share unverified social media messages or forwards. Science communication from the government needs to be more interactive, and public communication messaging should be more routine and easy to understand. There is a possibility scenario where reported COVID-19 cases may increase slightly in the days ahead, or in the months ahead — as it happened in April 2023 when daily cases had spiked. However, for most circulating respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, mere transmission or an increase in cases is not an immediate concern. Right now, SARS-CoV-2 infections do not appear to change clinical outcomes in any age groups.\\n\\nHow should we respond to current or any future uptick due to SARS-CoV-2? The short answer is in the same way that we respond to any seasonal rise in cases of flu, respiratory illnesses or dengue virus. By the government increasing standard public health preventive measures such as Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza-like Illness (ILI) surveillance, waste water surveillance and improving provision of required services at health facilities. The clinical management should focus on a syndromic approach to respiratory illnesses. At the individual and community levels, there is no need to disturb the routine or change your travel or vacation plans. People with cough and cold or flu-like illness must follow good respiratory etiquette such as wearing masks in public places, covering their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and frequent handwashing, irrespective of whether it is a type of SARS-CoV-2, seasonal flu or any other respiratory illness. It is proven that the risk to children is the lowest among any age group and thus, school closure should never be considered an option in response to a COVID-19 case surge.\\n\\nIt is time we handle SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 just like any other respiratory illness. It is more of an individual health concern than a public health concern. COVID-19 is not a novel virus any more and is here to stay. But it is not a reason to worry.\\n\\nDr. Chandrakant Lahariya is a medical doctor with over 15 years of work experience with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the India Country office, the regional office for Africa, Brazzaville; and the WHO headquarters in Geneva.

While the original Omicron strain (BA.1) is no longer circulating, Omicron subvariants are now driving most of the country’s SARS-CoV-2 infections. Omicron was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November 2021, and cases quickly began to surface and multiply in other countries. By December of that year, Omicron was causing daily case numbers in the U.S. to skyrocket to over a million. In 2022, it had spawned a number of subvariants. In 2023, a new Omicron strain called EG.5 (nicknamed “Eris”) is the dominant strain in the U.S., and experts are monitoring another new strain called BA.2.86 (nicknamed “Pirola”).\\n\\nHow contagious is it? Omicron’s subvariants are considered to be especially efficient spreaders of the disease. The original strain of Omicron was more transmissible than Delta was. One explanation was that more than 30 of Omicron’s mutations are on the virus’s spike protein, the part that attaches to human cells, and several of those are believed to increase the probability of infection.\\n\\nSeverity: Scientists are still working to learn more about whether the current Omicron strains cause more severe disease than their predecessors. Data has suggested that the original Omicron strain was less severe, in general, than previous variants, according to the CDC. But it has also been noted that surges in cases may lead to significant increases in hospitalizations and deaths, as they did during the variant’s spread at the beginning of 2022, when the estimated death rates went as high or higher than they were at the time of the Delta variant surge in the previous autumn.\\n\\nCan vaccination prevent it? The CDC says that while breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are expected, staying up to date with vaccinations is the best protection against Omicron. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of a new fall 2023 updated COVID-19 booster against EG.5 and BA.2.86, according to the CDC. Currently, the CDC says the updated vaccine is expected to be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization from the two recent subvariants.', 'There are several things about the coronavirus epidemic that are not very well understood, or explained by the facts at hand. For example, the unexpected five-month long decline in cases in India starting in mid-September last year. An even bigger surprise has been the ferocity of the second wave that has seen the daily count of cases in India soaring to more than four lakh.\\n\\nLack of ‘Covid-appropriate behaviour’ has been cited as one of the main reasons for the rapid rise in infections from March. But that is only part of the explanation. Even during the five-month lull, the adoption of masks wasn’t universal, nor was physical distancing being strictly followed. Election rallies have also been blamed, but these do not explain the phenomenal rise in cases in states such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab or Karnataka that had no elections. In any case, the second wave had started much before the large political rallies began to take place.\\n\\nNewsletter | Click to get the day’s best explainers in your inbox\\n\\nThe newer variants\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScientists have also been examining whether biological changes in the virus had anything to do with the unprecedented surge in infections in the last two months. Viruses mutate, and mutations that help it survive and circulate better are selected. In the last few months, several new variants of the virus have been found to be circulating in the Indian population.\\n\\nA few of these have greater transmissibility, meaning they have a better ability to infect human beings. One particular variant, called B.1.617, first found in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, has received a lot of attention because of its ability to transmit at a faster rate and, possibly, also to evade the immune response. Other fast-transmitting variants, such as the one that first emerged in the United Kingdom, called B 1.1.7, that has been found to be present in large numbers in northern India, could also be the reasons for the rapid rise in cases.\\n\\nSteep rise in new cases since March Steep rise in new cases since March\\n\\nWhile scientists acknowledge that these new variants could have contributed to the surge in cases, they have reluctant to say that these are the main cause for the ferocity of the second wave. They have been maintaining that the epidemiological evidence is still not clinching enough. On Wednesday, the government, for the first time, linked the B.1.617 variant with the surge seen in some states. But it reiterated that the clinical and epidemiological correlation was still not fully established.\\n\\nNot the same everywhere\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnurag Agrawal, director of Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said while the new variants had been found to be circulating in many parts of the country, not every surge in cases could be attributed to these. Even within a state, the spread of the virus in some areas could be directly because of these faster-transmitting variants, while in others some other factor could be responsible.\\n\\n“In Maharashtra, for example, the rise in cases in the Vidarbha region can possibly be explained by the emergence of the B.1.617 variant. But this variant does not explain the surge in Mumbai. That is because this variant has not been found in adequate numbers in the Mumbai population. There, the main reason for the rise could be something else… reopening of the local trains, possibly, in the month of February,” he said.\\n\\nIn Kerala, the new variant that is predominantly in circulation is N440K. But Agrawal said the surge in Kerala could not be attributed to this. “The locations where we found this variant were not the same where the maximum cases were getting reported from. In fact, the surge was found to be the maximum in areas where the presence of this variant was the least,” he said.\\n\\nIn Punjab and Haryana, however, there is little doubt about the cause of the surge. In both the states, the UK variant is predominant. In a recent study, more than 80% of the samples taken from infected people in Punjab were found to be of this variant. Neighbouring Delhi also has a large proportion of the UK variant, but in keeping with the character of the national capital which has people coming in from across the country, nearly every variant circulating in other states has marked a presence in Delhi as well. And there are hundreds of them, most of them having little or no impact on the rise in cases.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScientists say that in most places, a surge or a decline in cases can only be explained by a combination of factors. Almost every state has one variant or the other present, but in many places these have had no role in causing the increase in cases. As one of the scientists explained, epidemics are like complex systems where very small changes in inputs, or initial conditions, can lead to dramatic and unexpected outputs. So, at some places, even a large number of wedding gatherings on a particular day could be the reason for a prolonged surge. The exponential nature of the spread of an epidemic makes this possible.\\n\\nVariants under watch\\n\\nYet, the new variants are under close watch right now. The government has already classified the B.1.617 as a ‘variant of concern’ though that tag is still to be attached to it officially by the World Health Organization. As reported by this newspaper, this particular variant has undergone further mutations, and at least three different sub-variants, named B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3, are supposed to have the potential to spread even faster, and cause bigger damage than the parent variant.\\n\\nAgrawal said these three new variants were a cause of concern. “I am worried about the B.1.617, and the three new ones emerging from it. I am worried about the UK variant, and also the South African variant. But I am not too much worried about the Brazilian variant, or the B.1.618, or even the N440K. I am currently worried only about the variants that have the potential to cause explosive rise in cases,” he said.'], similarity=0.24163639545440674)]),\n",

Investors await more data scheduled for release this week to get a grip on which way the Fed could lean on the issue of interest rate cuts.The MCX April gold futures were trading at Rs 66140 per 10 grams, up by Rs 26 or 0.04% while May silver futures were trading at Rs 74,450 per kg, lower by Rs 68 or 0.09%. Track prices here The Dollar Index (DXY) is hovering above the 104 mark against a basket of six top currencies at 104.39, up by 0.16 points or 0.16%. It has gained 0.95% over the past five trading sessions.Gold has corrected by Rs 803 from its lifetime high of Rs 66,943 which it hit on Thursday. In the international markets, the prices had shot up above the $2,220 per troy ounce mark.MCX Gold and Silver futures ended with minor declines on Tuesday with the June gold contract settling with a downtick of Rs 6 per 10 grams or 0.01% at Rs 66,010 while the May silver contract ended down by Rs 29 or 0.04% at Rs 74,489 per kg.\"Gold prices have stayed near record highs for two days, as investors wait for important US economic data coming out this week. This data might affect the US Federal Reserve \\'s plans regarding interest rates. A key report expected on Friday, although markets will be closed, might show high inflation rates for February. This, along with recent strong US economic indicators suggests that interest rates might not be cut as some hoped,\" Neha Qureshi, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at Anand Rathi Commodities & Currencies said.Higher interest rates can have a negative impact on non-yielding gold.On the daily chart, MCX April gold contracts have formed an inverted hammer candlestick pattern indicating bearishness and with the RSI remaining in the overbought territory, a potential retracement in prices cannot be ruled out, Qureshi said. A surge beyond the 65,800 mark would solidify the bearish outlook, the Anand Rathi Analyst said as she puts key resistance levels at 66,440 -Rs 66,900 while support at Rs 65,550- Rs 65,050.The prices have risen by 5.67% or Rs 3,547 on MCX on a month-to-date basis, Anuj Gupta, Head Commodity & Currency, HDFC Securities said.

Year on year, gold is up 16.5%.\\n\\nInvestors who expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate are the main force driving up prices, but the surge is boosted by other factors, including central banks — led by China — buying up gold to ease reliance on US dollars.\\n\\nCentral banks see gold as a long-term store of value and a safe haven during times of economic and international turmoil.\\n\\nGold is considered a resilient investment. When interest rates fall, gold prices tend to rise, as bullion becomes more appealing than income-paying assets like bonds. Investors also regard gold as a hedge against inflation, betting bullion will retain its value when prices rise.\\n\\nThe People’s Bank of China bought gold for the 17th straight month in March, adding 160,000 ounces to bring reserves to 72.74 million troy ounces of gold, according to Reuters.\\n\\nCentral banks may want to “diversify away” from US dollars and buy gold amid geopolitical uncertainty, according to an April 9 UBS research note. As China builds its reserves, demand is pushing up prices already boosted by usual investors.\\n\\nChinese investors are looking to gold as an alternative asset amid downturns in property valuations and equity prices in past years, according to an April 9 Capital Economics research note.\\n\\nOther central banks, including India and Turkey, are also increasing their gold reserves. India’s GDP growth is driving those purchases, according to UBS.\\n\\nA sign of the times?\\n\\nCentral banks demanding gold is a sign of waning reliance on the dollar, according to Ulf Lindahl, CEO at Currency Research Associates.\\n\\nDollars are increasingly unappealing for central banks who want to decrease economic reliance on the US, Lindahl said in an email.\\n\\nNations not allied with the US may accumulate gold to “mix away from dollars” to reduce vulnerability to sanctions, according to a March JP Morgan research note.\\n\\nCentral bank buying has driven the rise in gold prices since 2022, according to the note. Gold could be entering a strong era, as central bank purchases of gold in 2022 were more than double the average annual purchase across the decade prior, according to JP Morgan.\\n\\nThe rise in prices comes amid US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s visit to China to discuss financial stability in US-China relations, including what Yellen called the overproduction of Chinese electric vehicles.\\n\\nOil prices are also on the rise, posing a threat to the US economy, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s.\\n\\nHigher oil prices are likely to stoke concerns over inflation, boosting gold prices, according to the UBS research note.\\n\\nThe usual perception of gold\\n\\nThe rise in gold prices signals investors are anticipating rate cuts from the Fed later this year but might be uncertain about the prospects of squashing inflation without throwing the US economy into recession, also known as a soft landing.\\n\\nUBS sees the expectation of Fed rate cuts as “still the main driver for bullish sentiment toward gold,” according to an April 9 research note.\\n\\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said in remarks April 3 that inflation is still on a “sometimes bumpy path” toward the Fed’s goal of 2%, and that rate cuts to rebalance the economy are likely to begin at some point later this year.\\n\\nFifty-one percent of investors currently expect a quarter-point cut in June, according to data from CME group. Yet job growth data for March exceeded expectations, calling into question the need for multiple rate cuts amid a still-strong economy.\\n\\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.5% for the 12 months ending in February. That’s a tick up from January’s 2.4% increase, according to Department of Commerce data released last month.\\n\\nOn a monthly basis, the core PCE price index that strips out the more volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.3%. The index, which Fed officials view as a crucial gauge of underlying inflation, was down from 0.4% in January, when it had grown at the fastest pace in one year.\\n\\nSo why is gold surging right now?\\n\\nSome investors are buying into the hype around gold bullion as prices rise, pushing them further up. On Reddit, proud gold buyers often post threads about their stashes.\\n\\nCostco began selling gold bars online in August and silver coins in January. The company may now be selling as much as $200 million in gold and silver each month, according to an estimate by Wells Fargo. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told analysts in December that the company had sold more than $100 million of gold bars in the prior quarter.\\n\\n“The accelerating frequency of Reddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and [the company’s] robust monthly eComm sales suggests a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch,” the April 9 investment note said.\\n\\nLindahl said that “trend followers” and others jump on the rise in prices as the background begins to point to substantially higher prices over the long term.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that gold is a traditional asset to hold during political uncertainty. Voters in more than 60 countries are set to head to the polls this year, including for the US presidential election. That uptick in geopolitical and economic unpredictability underscores the precious metal’s stable value.', 'The price of gold has climbed 17% in 2024.\\n\\nShoppers are flocking to Costco for gold bars but they\\'re hardly the only ones scooping up the precious metal.\\n\\nInvestors drove gold prices to a record high on Friday, the latest surge in a 17% rally so far this year. Over that period, bullion prices have climbed more than twice as fast as the S &P 500, the index that most people\\'s 401(k)\\'s track.\\n\\nThe price gains stem from a wider trend of investors seeking out high-return assets in anticipation of interest rate cuts expected later this year, some experts told ABC News.\\n\\nA so-called momentum trade has also pushed prices higher, they added, since investors see the price of gold swell and want to share in the gains.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing a situation where people are actually increasing their risk exposure,\" Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke\\'s Fuqua School of Business who studies commodity prices, told ABC News, noting that the typical price volatility of gold resembles that of the S &P 500.\\n\\n\"You see things like the S &P 500 going up and bitcoin going up,\" Harvey added. \"Gold is part of that.\"\\n\\nCostco has generated an estimated $100 million to $200 million per month in gold bar sales, Wells Fargo said in a recent equity research note.\\n\\nWhile the price is not disclosed online to nonmembers, the product typically sells for nearly 2% above the spot price, which as of time of publication stood at $2,430 per ounce.\\n\\nThe buying spree has also taken hold at central banks, UBS said in a report last week, citing some central banks\\' desire to move away from U.S. dollars and hedge against inflation risks.\\n\\nIn January and February, central banks purchased about 64 metric tons of gold and China imported 132 metric tons from Switzerland, a gold-refinery stalwart, UBS said.\\n\\nHedge funds and other institutional investors have also bought into the gold craze in an effort to capitalize on the commodity\\'s blistering rise, Campbell said. \"That institutional pressure is pushing the price of gold up,\" he added.\\n\\nGold prices have surged despite low activity in a key instrument for everyday investors: ETFs.\\n\\nAn ETF amounts to a bucket of securities that gives investors a way to bet that an underlying asset will increase in price without purchasing that asset.\\n\\nAn ETF for gold, in turn, allows individuals to put money on the price movement of the precious metal rather than buy, lug and store the physical item.\\n\\nOver the last 10 months, however, gold ETFs have incurred a net outflow of funds, meaning that on the whole the ETFs are losing investment rather than gaining it, Harvey said. That trend, he added, suggests retail investors are not a major cause of the price increase.\\n\\nShoppers outside a Costco store in Bayonne, NJ, Dec. 9, 2023. Angus Mordant/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nGold is also widely viewed as a hedge against geopolitical unrest because the millennia-old store of value is perceived as an investment that could outlive calamity.\\n\\nWorld Gold Council, a United Kingdom-based trade association for the gold industry, said global disruption could drive up prices this year, according to a January report.\\n\\n\"In addition to monetary policy, geopolitical uncertainty is often a key driver of gold demand and in 2024 we expect this to have a pronounced impact on the market,\" the World Gold Council report said.\\n\\nFor his part, Harvey cast doubt on the role of geopolitics in the price surge, since the onset of the rally did not coincide with the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war in October.\\n\\nInvestors aiming to put money in gold can do it in a variety of ways. In addition to purchasing the gold bars on offer at some stores like Costco, investors can put funds into a variety of gold ETFs or buy shares in gold mining companies.\\n\\nIndividuals can also invest in gold futures, contracts to buy or sell gold on an agreed-upon date, which essentially amount to a bet on the movement of the price.\\n\\nInvestors should beware, however, Harvey said, noting that bullion typically generates modest returns over the period following an all-time high. UBS expects the price of gold to tick up to $2,500 by the end of the year, according to its report last week.\\n\\n\"Investing at an all-time high is very risky,\" Harvey said.\\n\\nReporters at Good Morning America contributed to this report.'], similarity=0.4126548046867053)]),\n",

Burning fossil fuels and destroying forests have caused inestimable environmental harm by producing a warming effect through the artificial concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has risen by 50 percent in the past 200 years, much of it since the 1970s, raising in turn the Earth’s temperature by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nIndeed, since the 1970s, the decade which saw the rise of neoliberalism as the dominant economic ideology in the Western world, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90 percent. Unsurprisingly, average temperatures have risen more quickly over the past few decades, and the last 10 years have been the warmest years on record. In fact, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration analysis has confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, and all indications are that 2024 could be even hotter than 2023. In March, scientists at Copernicus Climate Change Service said that February 2024 was the hottest February, according to records going back to 1940.\\n\\nThe world is now warming faster than any point in recorded history. Yet, while the science of climate change is well established and we know both the causes and the effects of global warming, the rulers of the world are showing no signs of discontinuing their destructive activities that are putting Earth on track to becoming uninhabitable for humans. Emissions from Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s utter destruction of Gaza will undoubtedly have a significant effect on climate change. Analysis by researchers in the United Kingdom and United States reveals that the majority of global emissions generated in the first two months of the Israeli invasion of Gaza can be attributed to the aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Indeed, the destruction of Gaza is so immense that it exceeds, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II.\\n\\nFurther evidence that the rulers of the world view themselves as being separate and distinct from the world around them (in spite of the fact that all life on Earth is at risk) came during the recent CERAWeek oil summit in Houston, Texas, where executives from the world’s leading fossil fuel companies said that we should “abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas.” Who from the likes of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies gives a damn if the emissions from the burning of fossil fuels until 2050 causes millions of deaths before the end of the century? Oil and gas companies made tens of billions in annual net profit in 2023 as they continued to expand fossil fuel production.\\n\\nOf course, none of the above is to suggest that the game is over. The rulers of the world (powerful states, huge corporations, and the financial elite) are always pulling out all the stops to resist change and maintain the status quo. But common people are fighting back, and history has repeatedly shown that they will never surrender to the forces of reaction and oppression. We have seen a remarkable escalation of climate and political activism in general over the past several years — indeed, a sharp awakening of global public consciousness to the interconnectedness of challenges in the 21st century that leaves much room for hope about the future. Struggles against climate change are connected to the fight against imperialism, inequality, poverty and injustice. These struggles are not in vain, even when the odds seem stacked against them. On the contrary, they have produced some remarkable results.\\n\\nDeforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest is falling dramatically since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva came into office — a victory not only for the Brazilian people but for those across the world who care about the environment and justice. In North America, Indigenous communities scored major victories in 2023 in the struggle for conservation, protecting hundreds of thousands of acres of forest land and sacred and culturally significant sites from mining. Climate activists in Europe and the U.S. won major legal victories throughout 2023, such as the youth victory against the state of Montana. Similar climate litigation like Juliana v. United States is only expected to grow in 2024. As actor and climate activist Jane Fonda aptly put it on “Fire Drill Fridays,” a video program that was launched in 2019 by Fonda herself in collaboration with Greenpeace USA, “These lawsuits are not just legal maneuvers … but are at the crux of climate reckoning.”\\n\\nThese victories for our planet are more than enough proof that activism pays off and should be an acute reminder that the kind of transformational change we need will not start at the top. In 2018, the climate protest of a 15-year-old Swedish student captured the imagination of her own country and eventually “aroused the world,” to use the words of British broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. Indeed, just a year later, Greta Thunberg would be credited with leading the biggest climate protest in history.\\n\\nIt is grassroots environmental activism that created the political space for President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — the largest investment in clean energy and climate action in U.S. history. (It’s important to point out that the law stripped out many social and economic programs in the original draft that are critical for low-income communities and communities of color, and the law lacks a deep decarbonization pathway.) Environmental movements such as Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, and Letzte Generation have sparked a global conversation on the climate crisis and have opened up new possibilities for forcing the transition away from fossil fuels across Europe even in the face of a growing backlash by hard-line conservative and far right groups, and even as European governments crack down on climate protests.\\n\\nThe rulers of the world won’t save the planet. They have a vested interest in maintaining the existing state of affairs, whether it be oppression of the weak or continued reliance on fossil fuels. Radical political action is our only hope because voting alone will never solve our problems. Organizing communities, raising awareness and educating the public, and developing convincing accounts of change are key elements for creating real progress in politics. Indeed, as the recent history of environmental politics shows, climate activism is the pathway to climate defense.\\n\\nTired of reading the same old news from the same old sources? So are we!

The world last year lost about 37,000 square kilometers (14,000 square miles) of tropical primary forest, an area nearly as big as Switzerland and larger than the U.S. state of Maryland.\\n\\nGlobal Forest Watch is a project of the Washington-based nonprofit research organization World Resources Institute, using satellite imagery. Most of the data is compiled by University of Maryland researchers.\\n\\nDeclining forest loss in Brazil and Colombia was largely offset by greater losses elsewhere, Global Forest Watch director Mikaela Weisse told a press briefing.\\n\\n\"The world took two steps forward, two steps back,\" Weisse said.\\n\\nScientists consider tropical primary forests to be among the most precious as their lush vegetation is the most densely packed with carbon. These forests also are treasure troves of biodiversity. The Amazon rainforest, for instance, is home to at least 10% of Earth\\'s known species.\\n\\nLast year\\'s tropical primary forest loss caused greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to half of U.S. emissions caused by the burning fossil of fuels annually, Weisse said.\\n\\nBrazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia topped the ranking of tropical countries with the most primary forest loss. That is in spite of destruction in Brazil falling 36%, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pursued aggressive conservation policies, particularly regarding the Amazon, Weisse said.\\n\\nNeighboring Colombia experienced a 49% drop in forest loss. President Gustavo Petro made environmental preservation a key part of the peace process with armed groups that dominate jungle areas, Weisse noted.\\n\\nForest destruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo remained relatively stable but high at around 1,930 square miles.\\n\\nIn third place, Bolivia experienced record-high primary forest loss for the third year in a row, with destruction surging 27%. Agricultural production and fires drove most of the loss.\\n\\nDEFORESTATION INCREASED\\n\\nDeforestation globally rose 3.2% in 2023, according to the report.\\n\\nForest loss includes natural destruction such as wildfires, pests and windstorms of woodlands that may grow back. Deforestation refers to people permanently converting woodlands to other uses such as agriculture and is harder to measure.\\n\\nMore than 140 countries in 2021 committed to end deforestation by the end of the decade, a goal that requires huge declines in destruction each year, World Resources Institute forests director Rod Taylor said.\\n\\n\"We are far off track and trending in the wrong direction when it comes to reducing global deforestation,\" Taylor said.\\n\\nBrazil, Indonesia and Bolivia led in deforestation, followed closely by the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\nCANADA WILDFIRES OFF THE CHARTS\\n\\nTree cover loss increased 24% in all forests globally in 2022, mostly because of enormous wildfires in Canada.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nCanada\\'s forest loss of more than 80,000 square km (30,900 square miles) was three times higher than any year on record, offsetting a decline in forest loss in the rest of the world.\\n\\n\"That is one of the biggest anomalies on record,\" University of Maryland researcher Matt Hansen said.\\n\\nWhile deforestation in the tropics is a human-caused driver of climate change, the fires in Canada are more of a symptom of global warming, which leads to the hotter, drier conditions that fuel bigger blazes.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a big deal, and it\\'s a cautionary tale for climate impacts to fire,\" Hansen said.', 'Taking Charge: Three Actions to Help Combat Climate Change and Save Amazonia\\n\\nNEW YORK, Apr 4 2024 (IPS) - Climate change is the defining crisis of our time––it is the ultimate equalizer from which no one is immune. The Earth’s ecosystems are on the brink of collapse, threatening biodiversity and human societies in unprecedented ways at a global scale.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe planet is currently experiencing the warmest years on record, accompanied by a rise in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. As a “threat multiplier,” the climate crisis will continue to exacerbate already existing challenges.\\n\\nThese challenges include the alteration of 75% of the land surface and 55% of the ocean, the destruction of 32 million hectares of tropical forests between 2010 and 2015, and the thousandfold increase in species extinction rates.\\n\\nThese interconnected crises, linked to culture, education, economics, politics, and the environment, pose an urgent existential threat to humanity.\\n\\nAmazonia plays a crucial role in the global fight against climate change. Home to approximately 47 million people, 2.2 million of whom are Indigenous, and housing more than 10% of the planet’s biodiversity, it stands as the world’s largest river basin and megadiverse tropical forest.\\n\\nThis region serves as a global repository of natural resources, providing essential ecosystem services to the entire planet, including water and nutrient recycling, mediation of infectious diseases, ecotourism, and food production.\\n\\nAmazonian forests act as a colossal “air-conditioner,” reducing land surface temperatures and generating rainfall. They influence atmospheric circulation within and outside the tropics through the maintenance of aerial rivers, shaping moisture patterns across South America and contributing to the largest river discharge on Earth.\\n\\nFurthermore, Amazonia helps regulate global biogeochemical and atmospheric cycles, serving as a key buffer against climate change by storing about 150-200 billion tons of carbon in its soils and vegetation.\\n\\nYet, the region faces intense extraction processes endangering its ecosystems and peoples. Deforestation, habitat fragmentation, the overexploitation of natural resources, the expansion of large-scale infrastructure, and pollution (particularly mercury pollution) pose significant threats to Amazonia’s rich socio-biodiversity.\\n\\nMoreover, Amazonia is approximately 1.1°C warmer than it was 40 years ago, and the increased frequency of extreme climate events, like the recent record-breaking droughts, are wreaking havoc on Amazonian terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and local communities. These factors place the region’s plants and animals at high risk of extinction, undermine carbon storage and sequestration, and diminish resilience.\\n\\nIf current trends continue, Amazonia will be pushed closer to crossing a point of no return, or “tipping point,” a state in which continuous forests can no longer exist and are replaced by degraded, open canopy ecosystems.\\n\\nCrossing a tipping point would unleash potentially irreversible cascading effects, accelerating global warming, leading to decreased aerial rivers, droughts and heatwaves in central South America, and mass species extinctions.\\n\\nAddressing the climate and biodiversity crises––including by conserving Amazonia and preventing it from reaching a tipping point––requires implementing solutions that match the magnitude of the challenges faced.\\n\\nAchieving a “Living Amazon,” reaching climate stability and protecting biodiversity, requires urgent action across multiple scales to limit the rise in global temperatures by mid-century and eliminate deforestation, degradation, and wildfires in Amazonia by 2030.\\n\\nThe complexity of these crises cannot be addressed by placing the sole responsibility on governments and industry. Doing so demands both bottom-up and top-down actions, systemic transformations of our production and consumption systems, and significant restoration efforts.\\n\\nActions at the individual, household, and community levels have been proven to be more impactful than many realize. While individuals often feel hopeless about their ability to influence change on a large scale, the collective impact of individual behavior change, when adopted by billions of people, can make a decisive difference.\\n\\nHere, three impactful actions are presented that individuals can integrate into their daily lives to help combat climate change and save Amazonia.\\n\\nAction 1: Adopting Mindful Daily Habits\\n\\nSimple daily choices can influence the health of Amazonia. Minimizing food waste and switching to plant-based meals cuts emissions alleviates pressure on forests and land used for cattle ranching and animal feed production, aiding in the fight against deforestation.\\n\\nBy being aware of product origins, individuals can also support responsible sourcing practices and sustainable value chains that benefit both the environment and local communities in Amazonia. Through these actions, individuals help bolster socio-bioeconomies and empower Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs).\\n\\nAction 2: Expanding Knowledge of the Amazon\\n\\nEngaging with educational resources, like the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA)’s massive open online course, “The Living Amazon: Science, Cultures and Sustainability in Practice,” can deepen individuals’ understanding of the threats the Amazon faces and how to be part of the solution.\\n\\nAction 3: Advocate for Amazonia\\n\\nRaising awareness and advocating for policies promoting conservation, Indigenous rights and knowledge, and sustainable development are crucial to protecting Amazonia and addressing climate change. This includes advocating for the implementation of nature-based solutions, such as the Arcs of Restoration, a socio-bioeconomy of healthy standing forests and flowing rivers, and the bioindustrialization of forest products.\\n\\nSupporting political candidates who prioritize climate action, environmental conservation, and the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities can also play a critical role in the development of policies and regulations that conserve Amazonia in the years to come.\\n\\nWhen reflecting on this upcoming Earth Day (on April 22) the challenges facing the planet, it is essential to remember that systemic change begins with individual actions. The actions outlined here––adopting mindful daily habits, expanding knowledge, and advocating for Amazonia––collectively form a powerful force for positive change.\\n\\nTogether, these actions symbolize a shared commitment to a more sustainable future, where Amazonia and the planet can thrive.\\n\\nJulie Topf is Program Associate, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Gabriela Arnal is Communications Consultant, Science Panel for the Amazon.\\n\\nIPS UN Bureau'], similarity=0.4882107575734456), Origin(name='Google', url=['https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/10/brazil-record-deforestation-amazon-rainforest-lula-bolsonaro#:~:text=Government%20satellites%20show%20that%20a,the%20month%20since%20records%20began.', 'https://news.mongabay.com/2023/06/the-amazon-saw-record-deforestation-last-year-heres-why/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67962297'], data=['Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest rose in February to the highest level on record for the month, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing the administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as it tries to undo the environmental destruction wreaked under the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro.\\n\\nGovernment satellites show that a record 322 sq km of Amazon rainforest were destroyed in February, a 62% increase on last year and the highest number for the month since records began.\\n\\nLula, who took office on 1 January this year, has pledged to end illegal logging after deforestation soared to a 15-year high during the Bolsonaro years.\\n\\nWith the environment ministry once again led by the environmentalist Marina Silva, who oversaw a sharp drop in deforestation in the same role during Lula’s first term in office, the government has reactivated the Amazon Fund, a key tool for preservation, and recreated a civil society council on the environment – both abandoned under Bolsonaro.\\n\\nSilva has also brushed off and updated a deforestation prevention and control plan that formed the backbone of her successful policies nearly two decades ago.\\n\\nThese are important steps, but “innovation is necessary, as the Amazon today is not the same as it was 10, 20 years ago”, said a Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson, Rômulo Batista.\\n\\nCrime and violence exploded under the previous government, as Bolsonaro’s disdain for the rainforest and the people who protect it emboldened criminals of all kinds, including the killers of the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Addressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist, a process which cannot happen overnight, said Batista.\\n\\n“The land grabber, the deforester, the illegal miner, they are making the most of this time to rush to cut the forest down,” Batista said.\\n\\nAfter preliminary data pointed towards the jump in destruction in February, Silva told reporters last month that loggers were working even during the Amazon’s rainy season as a “sort of revenge” against the current government’s crackdown.\\n\\nDeforestation figures are typically lower at the start of the year, as the Amazon rainy season hinders forest clearing and cloud cover means satellites are less likely to pick up on it. For this reason, analysts had cautioned against celebrating a drop in deforestation in January.', 'An estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021.\\n\\nIt was the worst year for deforestation since 2004, according to Amazon Conservation’s Monitoring of the Amazon Project (MAAP), which analyzed satellite readings from Global Forest Watch.\\n\\nThe deforestation was caused by cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.\\n\\nLast year, the Amazon saw some of the highest rates of deforestation in over a decade, due to a combination of cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects that cleared millions of acres of rainforest.\\n\\nAn estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021 and the highest figure on record except for 2004, when over 2 million hectares (about 5 million acres) were lost.\\n\\n“The 2022 deforestation data is a stark reminder that we are in a race against time for the Amazon. With deforestation rates the highest they have been since 2004, the ecological integrity of the Amazon is in jeopardy,” said Leila Salazar-López, executive director of Amazon Watch.\\n\\nThe figures come from Global Forest Watch satellite readings on deforestation and fire hotspots, which were processed and published in a report by Amazon Conservation’s Monitoring of the Amazon Project (MAAP).\\n\\nAll six countries that share the Amazon Rainforest — Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela — experienced deforestation last year, but none of them were hit as hard as Brazil. It lost a total of 1.4 million hectares (3.45 million acres) of primary forest, making it the worst year of deforestation since a historic peak between 2002 and 2005.\\n\\nFormer President Jair Bolsonaro, who left office at the end of last year, has been accused of worsening deforestation by failing to demarcate a single Indigenous territory while at the same time encouraging economic activity in the rainforest that led to some of the highest greenhouse gas emissions in years.\\n\\nSatellite readings show that a lot of the forest loss is concentrated around roads, most notably the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the states of Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia and Acre. The incomplete BR-319 highway, connecting Manaus to Porto Velho, has been criticized by conservationists who say the road will open up more areas of the rainforest to human activity.\\n\\nThe country with the second-worst deforestation was Bolivia, which saw 245,177 hectares (605,845 acres) of deforestation last year, by far the highest rate for the country on record. It was a 47% jump from 2021. Fires also directly impacted another 106,922 hectares (264,210 acres).\\n\\nThe deforestation was mostly driven by soy production in the southeast department of Santa Cruz, according to MAAP. The country has also seen a growing presence of Mennonite communities over the last two decades, with much of the land being encroached upon under questionable legal circumstances.\\n\\nPeru is also struggling with a Mennonite problem in the central Amazon. A separate MAAP report last year found that various colonies were responsible for nearly 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of deforestation. And while that and gold mining have received the most attention from policymakers and conservationists, the data suggests that much of the 144,682 hectares (357,517 acres) lost last year in Peru actually came from small-scale agriculture.\\n\\n“We focus on the most obvious cases, like the gold mining and the Mennonites,” said Matt Finer, MAAP director and senior research specialist at Amazon Conservation. “We really target those cases because they’re important, but then you still have this 90% that’s a slow death by a thousand cuts — the expansion that no one really has a handle on.”\\n\\nColombia saw 97,417 hectares (240,722 acres) of deforestation last year, making it the only country to experience a decrease from the previous year, albeit by just 2%. Most of it took place in a corridor that cuts through the central departments of Caquetá, Meta, and Guaviare. Protected areas there — such as Chiribiquete National Park and Nukak Maku Indigenous reserve — have been fending off cattle ranchers and guerrilla groups.\\n\\nEcuador, although having a much smaller piece of the Amazon than the other countries, suffered a proportionally higher spike in deforestation. It lost 18,902 hectares (46,707 acres) last year — up 80% from 2021. In addition to mining, much of that can be attributed to palm oil and other agricultural plantations.\\n\\nNow moving into 2023, there’s some concern that the El Niño warm front will exacerbate fires and increase forest loss for the year. But there’s also hope that a change in government in Brazil — now under the more environmentally friendly President Lula da Silva — will lower deforestation rates for much of the Amazon.\\n\\n“We’re optimistic about things going down in Brazil with Lula,” Finer said. “But I still think the rest of the Amazon is still much lower profile. I don’t think many aren’t paying enough attention to what’s going on.”\\n\\nBanner image: The Peruvian Amazon. Photo by Rhett A.

A 2015 analysis6 of 321 plots of Amazon primary forest with no overt human impacts reported “a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation”. A similar study7 published in 2020 reported the same things in the Congo Basin forest — the world’s second-largest tropical jungle.\\n\\nThat’s a change from previous decades, when censuses indicated that such primary forest in the Amazon was storing more carbon. There is no consensus explanation for these slowdowns, or why primary forest was accumulating carbon. But many researchers suspect that the carbon gains in previous decades stem from the influence of extra CO 2 in the atmosphere, which can stimulate the growth of plants. In some studies that expose large forest plots to elevated CO 2 , known as free-air carbon enrichment (FACE) experiments, researchers have measured gains in biomass. But this effect lasted only a few years in one experiment8, and other studies have not yet determined whether the gains are temporary.\\n\\nAll of the forest FACE experiments have so far been conducted in temperate regions, however. And many scientists suspect that tropical forests — and the Amazon, in particular — might follow different rules. The first tropical-forest FACE experiment is finally under construction, 50 kilometres north of Manaus. Nobre says that it could help to predict whether continued increases in CO 2 will benefit the Amazon.\\n\\nFor several decades, Nobre and his students have used computer models to forecast how climate change and deforestation will affect the Amazon. The research grew, in part, from work in the 1970s showing that the Amazon forest itself helps to create the conditions that nourish it9. Moisture blowing in from the Atlantic falls as rain in the eastern Amazon and is then transpired and blown farther west. It recycles several times before reaching the Andes. A smaller or seriously degraded forest would recycle less water, and eventually might not be able to support the lush, humid forest.\\n\\nIn their 2016 study2, Nobre and several colleagues estimated the Amazon would reach a tipping point if the planet warms by more than 2.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures and if 20–25% of the Amazon is deforested. The planet is on track to reach 2.5 °C of warming by 2100, according to a report released by the United Nations last October.\\n\\nNobre now wonders whether his earlier study was too conservative. “What Luciana Gatti’s paper shows is that this whole area in the southern Amazon is becoming a carbon source.” He is convinced that, although the Amazon is not at the tipping point yet, it might be soon.\\n\\nSusan Trumbore, director of the Max Planck Institute of Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany, is not a fan of using the term tipping point, a phrase with no precise definition, to discuss the Amazon. But she says that the forest’s future is in question. “We all think of a tipping point as it’s going to happen and it’s going to happen fast. I have a feeling that it’s going to be a gradual alteration of the ecosystem that we know is coming with climate change,” she says. Regardless of whether the change will be fast or slow, Trumbore agrees with the majority of scientists who study the Amazon that it is facing serious challenges that might have global ramifications.', '\"I don\\'t think that [tipping point] is what we are seeing [yet], at least in all but the driest part of the Amazon forest,\" says Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the latest study.', 'Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\\n\\nThe study suggests that 10% to 47% of the landscape is at risk of transitioning away from rainforest by 2050 if warming and rates of deforestation aren’t dramatically curbed.\\n\\n“So many stressors are intensifying — climatic ones and land use stressors — when you combine these, they all end up causing water stress in the forest,” said Bernardo Flores, a lead author of the paper who is an ecologist and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Santa Catarina, in Florianópolis, Brazil. “It can reach a point where the forest is no longer capable of persisting.”\\n\\nThe Amazon contains about 10% of the world’s land-based biodiversity and stores incredible amounts of carbon in its dense trees. The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.\\n\\nFlores said that the changes outlined in the study are already happening but that he was optimistic they could be slowed or even halted.\\n\\n“I’m hoping in this paper, our findings will show the urgency if we don’t act within the next 30 years,” Flores said.\\n\\nThe study focuses on overlapping stressors to the Amazon, namely from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires. It describes how those factors could combine to break down the Amazon’s water and carbon cycles.\\n\\n“The Amazon is massive and maintains its own water cycle,” said Ernesto Alvarado, a research associate professor at the University of Washington’s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, who was not involved in the study. “If the balance breaks, it’s a major problem.”\\n\\nIf deforestation, wildfires, droughts and climate change reduce the amount of forested land that absorbs water, less moisture would be available to the atmosphere from plants, reducing the amount of rain to sustain the landscape.\\n\\nAbout 15% of the Amazon has already been lost, Flores said.'], similarity=0.5917054414749146)])]"
